Overview
Jam is a highly mobile, offense-oriented rushdown character who excels at up-close pressure and dealing heavy damage off openings. 
Jam's defining mechanic is her cards. By using Breath of AsanagiGuard:Startup:Recovery:Total 53Advantage:, Jam can charge up a card corresponding to one of three kick specials. These specials are RyujinGuard:AllStartup:17Recovery:25+11 after landingAdvantage:-23, a screen-crossing flying kick, KenroukakuGuard:MidStartup:7Recovery:21+6 after landingAdvantage:-36, a DPDragon Punch A move that has invulnerability during its startup, long recovery, and a rising motion., and GekirinGuard:High/AirStartup:19Recovery:3+10 after landingAdvantage:-9, an overhead kick. By spending one corresponding card, Jam can input the move with the D button to perform an empowered version of said move with a variety of improved properties. All three kick specials can be cancelled into enhanced kick specials, allowing for significant damage and corner carry. Jam's card specials unlock Jam's most damaging conversions and improve her gameplan drastically overall, making Jam a much more powerful character when she builds them. 
Jam's normals generally lack range, but are very fast and typically advantageous on block, as well as most hits leading to high damage with the right cards. Jam also has a powerful command dashGuard:Startup:Recovery:Total 46Advantage: and various command movement options to maintain pressure once within range. Her command dash also has four unique followups, each with their own use in neutral and pressure, making it a versatile part of Jam's kit. Jam also has very fast and rewarding AbareAn attack during the opponent's pressure, intended to interrupt it. options and a a ParryAn attack or mechanic that allows the defender to brush aside an incoming hit and recover more or less instantly. in addition to Kenroukaku, giving her strong and versatile defensive options.
However, due to her overall poor reach, Jam struggles with contesting zoning or approaching the opponent She will generally need to rely on mobility to control space, since she lacks a strong long-ranged PokeAn attack that's thrown out to occupy the space in front of you and remind your opponent not to try and come closer. Usually, this is a far-reaching and safe normal move with little risk. or other common ranged options. She commonly needs to take risks to approach the opponent, utilizing advancing options such as Ryujin or her fast airdash to close the distance and avoid the opponent.

 Jam Kuradoberi is a mobile and versatile rushdown character who can empower her Kick Specials with Cards to make them incredibly deadly and excels at close range.



Pros
Cons


High Damage With Cards: With cards, Jam can easily deal 50% health combos off of even stray hits. Her carded combos also carry the opponent to the corner, and all four of her supers can be used to end a combo with a powerful finisher.
Strong Pressure: Some moves are difficult to contest once Jam gets in range, and her command dash has four follow-ups that each have purpose in mixups, gap closing, and pressure resets. Her 6H is highly advantageous and invulnerable to throws, making it a powerful pressure tool.
Good Knockdowns With Cards: Jam can consistently knock the opponent down with cards, and can replenish her resources and re-establish threat afterwards.
Great Mobility: A fast dash and airdash let Jam move around the screen very quickly. Her air normals and tricky to whiff punish specials can make contesting her difficult.
High Tension Pulse: As Jam is always moving forward and uses her specials to control space, she has very high Tension gain. Her meter can be spent for use in mixups, pressure, generating cards, or damage output.
Defensive Options: Has two 3 frame reversals. Her Parry is a strong tool which removes any blockstun on success and allows Jam to break out of pressure in ways others cannot.


Limited Range: Jam is outranged by the entire cast, which can make getting in or controlling neutral difficult.
Weak to Zoning: With no projectile nor means of dealing with them, Jam has no direct way to deal with strong zoning. Successfully using her dash, airdash, and Ryujin are key to approaching, but all come with their own risks.
Needs Resources for Mixups: Jam has limited meterless high/low mixup without enhanced Gekirin or meter to spend on RC. Her strike/throw mixups are strong, but her throw has poor reward without cards or its FRC.
Mediocre Anti-Air: 6P isn't a great anti-air. HochifuGuard:Startup:Recovery:Advantage: is a strong and rewarding option you can OS with 6P, but it can be exploited as well. Jam must sometimes rely on rising air normals, her air throw, or Kenroukaku to deal with opponents approaching by the air.




Unique Mechanics
Cards

Cards 
Jam can use one of her specials to prepare cards which enhance her other specials by granting them new properties. Using the D instead of K button for the following specials results in the listed changes:

Ryuujin: Startup reduced from 17f to 11f. Strike invulnerability from 1-9f, increased from 1-4f. Sticks the opponent to the wall instead of bouncing them off it.
Gekirin: Startup reduced from 19f to 12f. Hits crouching opponents on 18f instead of 21f. Has three hits instead of one. Becomes untechable, meaning it will always knock down.
Kenroukaku: Startup reduced from 7f to 3f. Hits 7 times instead of 4. Gains additional forward momentum. Becomes untechable.
These cards take time to prepare, and as such are usually prepared after a knockdown, or at full screen. Jam can use Breath of Asanagi to gain one card for one special, with 22K giving a card for Ryujin, 22S giving one for Gekirin, 22H giving one for Kenroukaku. The FB version gives Jam one card for all three specials.

StartupThe time before an attack is active including the first active frame. For example, an attack with 10F startup means the attack will do nothing for 9 frames, then hit the opponent on the 10th frame. frames



ActiveThe active frames of an attack refers to the amount of time an attack can hit the opponent. Frames



InactiveFrames in the middle of multi-hit attacks which cannot hit the opponent, but are after the move has become active at least once. Frames



RecoveryThe recovery of an attack refers to the amount of time an attacker must wait before he may perform another action, even blocking. Frames

Standing jab with remarkable startup and a high hitbox. Typical way to start pressure up-close due to its speed, gatling options, and advantage on block. Whiffs on a lot of crouching characters, and some standing characters like Zappa. Can catch people trying to jump out of pressure, or be used to quickly anti-air after a parry.

Fast, plus on block standing low. Useful in pressure due to the aforementioned properties in addition to its nonstandard 6F hitstop, which makes tick throws harder to react to. Also a common piece of combo filler in corner loops, and can be used in neutral similarly to 2S depending on the matchup.

Full counter hit state for the entire move's duration. Exercise caution.

Combos into TK Ryujin and characters at least as tall as Millia for big damage.
One of Jam's best options to convert into an air combo from the ground.

Pressure extraordinaire.

Oppressive move on contact. +1 on block, and three hits means you build guard bar like mad.
Has some upper body invulnerability and low profiles on the last hit.
Third hit vacuums, keeping Jam in range for mixups and pressure resets off the slight frame advantage.
Forces crouching on hit for stronger confirms.
Gatlings into long-range, jump-cancellable 6K and f.S, valuable reverse gatlings that provides versatility in Jam's blockstrings for ambiguous pressure resets.
Miserable on whiff, and if pushed out with FD before the third hit connects and vacuums, Jam is -7. Be wary of spacing.
Oppressive normal which often leads to the very scary 6H. Mixed with throws and other delayed pokes for frame traps, this becomes a go-to in pressure. In neutral, this move can be used to confirm into 6H to begin one of Jam's Card Ryujin combos, but be warned that it can push your opponent away from you at far ranges. Thus, try confirming into 6H early into the move's active frames to ensure that you can begin the combo.

Plus 2 on block, in case they didn't take the bait.
Both hits stagger on grounded CH for easier confirms
Gatlings from and to 2P for pressure cycles and repeated frame traps.
Typical style 6P for an infighter. The extensive upper body invul can be used to blow through projectiles. Eg. parry a meaty Charged Stun Edge and going into a 6P is a basic strategy against Ky.

Fairly weak normal, but forces standing on hit.

Good for pressure after a blocked 5H.
Horribly unsafe, make sure you cancel into something else. Both hits are jump cancelable.
First hit has nonstandard hitstop which could make useful for an early cancel.
Forced standing might be useful to combo into TK Ryujin or something.
Notable for huge frame advantage for Jam after 6K(1) > 2D FRC. If FRC'd on the first frame, Jam is around +9 on normal block.
Mainly used as a blockstring option to gatling out of 5H and back to the beginning of the gatling ladder to continue pressure, 6K has value in an open gatling table that allows reverse gatlings and pressure resets. Can cancel into 2K or 2D for a low late into a blockstring, 2P for plus frames on block, or even on whiff to make 6K safe at longer ranges. Can be jump canceled for safety, to enable TK Gekirin, or IAD pressure resets. Long-range means it's likely to be in range after a blocked 5H(3). A utility normal that finds no real place in combos.

A powerful explosive-force-stomp-plus-palm strike. Don't even read this. Just look at the hitbox.

One of the most oppressive normals in the game, both in neutral and in pressure.
Will sometimes hit behind Jam for some reason.
Throw invul through entire startup.
Has a custom amount of blockstun and hitstun making it +3 on block and +8 on hit and even more on CH
The hurtbox on Jam's lower body shrinks to her back leg, letting this move beat some low strikes.
In CH state for the entire move, but will usually blow back through standard poking attempts like mashing 2P.
Slow enough that it can be Slashbacked if your opponent is sharp enough and looking for it.  Don't get too predictable.

Extremely fast sweep with great range for Jam. Valuable poke in neutral, combo filler to confirm into carded Ryuujin on most of the cast, and is jump cancelable to enable pressure resets. 
Notable for having an FRC window starting frame 1, which means Jam can effectively FRC any normal that can gatling into 2D. Used this way, Jam gets huge frame advantage off of blocked normals, specifically 6K(1), 6P, and f.S. Because the window starts frame 1 and lasts 6 frames, it's easy to execute and allows pressure resets from any situation.  

Combos to 236S~K, but timing is character specific.

Average throw but with free followups. Gives a short superjump combo, but no knockdown without meter or cards.
With FRC and/or cards, throw becomes a terrifying damage threat for Jam, leading to full 2H > 6H wall-loop conversions and a hard knockdown. Due to Jam's strength as a strike/throw character, throw FRC is her most important FRC to learn, as the threat of it leads to more value from her numerous frametraps. As a visual cue for the FRC window, the window appears when Jam has fully retracted her legs in her animation, as she's about to kick her opponent.

CH grants same followups as FRC, but more prorated.

Jam's unique power-up move, providing her the icon cards needed to expend for enhanced specials per card.

A big corner stone of Jam's game. If you don't have meter for 22D or want it to save it for something later, this is the way to go move after a knockdown.
Most characters will want to Play the Zoning and keep away game against Jam. If they are playing too passive against you, charging cards fullscreen will not only grant you cards, but also make them try to stop you, and Jam wants their opponents as close as possible.
Rule of thumb: if you don't have any charged cards already, you'll want to priotize Charged Ryuujin over Charged Kenroukaku, Charged Gekirin being the least important.

Please note all version of Ryuujin hitboxes are not that great. There's no disjoint on them, a lot of moves will beat them, and most can crouch under the entire duration. Yolo Ryuujin at your own risk.


236K
Conversion and punish tool.

Mostly overshadowed by the TK version of Ryuujin. Worse damage and frame data, although some combos, mostly max f.S > TK Ryuujin will fail where Ground Ryuujin succeeds.
Very Shitty Reversal, but you could technically get a CH punish out of it, and CH Ryuujin is pretty good

j.236K
TK Ryuujin is a force to be reckoned with. A mainstay in Jam's combo game in conjuction of Powered Ryuujin

Using TK Ryuujin sparringly is a good way to maneuver around the field.
IAD Ryuujin stops Jam on her track, turning Aerial Ryuujin in a lingering hitbox meant to stop Anti Air and Air to Air attempts. This is horribly unsafe on whiff, but it's useful to keep in mind.

236D
Powered Ryuujin is one of Jam's most important moves. Learn to love this move.

Does good damage and wallsplats from anywhere on the screen, enabling easy combos. Depending on how high the wallsplat is, tension/cards may have to be used, but generally you can get free continuations.
Having a stocked Ryuujin card will force opponents to play on point, as this makes a speedy and debilitating whiff punish.
Strike invuln makes it an extremely rewarding, though very predictable and punishable, reversal option.

On paper, an off the ground 19f overhead sounds awesome. However, grounded Gekirin goes high in the air, goes active in the air, and then has to fall down, similar to the woes of Greed Sever. It's dubious as to whether you can even really get a good combo off this - ignore it and go straight for TK Gekirin.


j.214K
Air version that is slightly faster and overall better. Still props Jam up when activated. Highly useful as a neutral tool, as IABD Gekirin is a relatively safe way to put a hitbox on screen and can wall out characters trying to chase Jam down.

Unlike grounded Gekirin, this version groundbounces, making it a great combo starter.
Make sure to TK it, the lower to the ground you are the easier the conversion.
IAD Gekirin will make Jam plummet down instead of making an arc. Depending on how you time it, you can get an ambigous Cross-up.

214D
This Version is both a faster overhead and a better combo tool (with cards). It's better for conversions against high airborne opponents than 236D but utterly kills the damage of the combo after it due to terrible GB-.

Jam's reversal and sometimes anti air.

623K > 623D turns this move from an annoying reversal to a downright nasty punish to meaties.
Produces four hits quickly with little space between them, which can be useful for summons, armor, and even clashes.

j.623K
Not very good on its own aside from combos. You are probably looking for the IAD version

IAD Kenroukaku, Just Like IAD Gekirin, sends Jam downwards instead of upwards. Although the invincibility period is small, it may just be enough to beat some weaker grounded anti airs

623D
An incredible move with massive amounts of invulnerability. Perfect for anti-airing overly-aggressive approaches or reversaling out of pressure. Makes Jam really annoying to pressure for long periods of time if she has this stocked. Has custom hitstop that makes it harder for characters like Dizzy to OS against it with fish out.
Card Kenroukaku is also an essential air-conversion tool, as it causes the opponent to be launched up and dropped down after Jam has already landed, no matter the height. Any air hit can instantly be combo'd into Card Kenroukaku and put into Jam's grounded loops. Sadly, it prorates heavily, but the meter gain from the combos you can get with this move mean you can pretty much immediately perform 22D after it as a tradeoff, and it produces a hefty six hits. An overall exceptional special.

Bakushuu on its own is Jam's way to approach quickly and safely through ground projectiles and higher-hitting pokes. Shrinks Jam's hurtbox significantly while travelling and has some screenshake for the endorphins.

Bakushuu has 6 different follow-ups, P (Avoid) , K (Low), S (Puffball), H (Dash Twice then Puffball/Cross-up Puffball), D (FB Puffball), and 236P (Flip).
Bakushuu can also be canceled into Jam's carded kicks (236D, 214D, and 623D), and retains horizontal momentum to travel a surprising amount of space.

Jam will dash twice when doing this move. If you are far away, normal version will come out. It has some added benefits when compared to normal Puffball:

It's +4 on block
It will always wallbounce, be it a normal hit or a Counter hit. Near the corner or with counter-hit, starts a combo.
Has an FRC point at 21~24F to do a throw on whiff or get better conversion on hit if done at the 24th frame.
The wallbounce on hit and fast movement makes it a useful combo tool, allowing Jam to cross the screen to followup on wallsplats or even just to extend a combo point blank. It has some use in chasing an opponents in the air and/or trying to anti-air them, or as a very straightforward call out against full-screen summons or resource collecting. 
Still, this move is gimmicky as all hell and keen players will stop you in your tracks if you abuse it, so don't use it purely to close the gap in neutral.


If Jam is close to the opponent, crossup version comes out. 
It's generally a worse Puffball, except for one thing, the Dizzy modifier is astonishingly high. With Jam's IK being one of the best in the game, any dizzy usually turns into a death scenario. Risky, but has its uses.

Requires insanely close distance to convert off the wallbounce. On counter-hit it will convert easily, but gauging the distance to the corner will be hard since Jam isn't moving forwards as much.

j.236P




Until landing+2





Somewhat unusual movement tool in Jam's arsenal. Jam quickly flips off the ground diagonally upwards and forwards, focusing on verticality. When she does, she turns around, so even if you don't go over the top of the opponent all of your inputs will be backwards (e.g. 236P to flip, but inputting 236K in air will give you Gekirin as you are now facing left). Typically called "Flip".

FRC point at 6~8F will instead send Jam over the ground at a low angle without turning her around. More horizontal movement than normal flip.
Intended for cross-ups. This can be considered the only way to Attack high from a Bakushuu.
You can do it on its own or as a followup/cancel to Bakushuu, this being the only way to deal with sliding moves like Grand Viper, Robo-Ky's 2K, etc...

Aerial Flip gives a bigger emphasis on horizontal movement. Great for avoiding certain moves. Turns her backwards like regular flip.

IAD Choujin sends her straight down. Just like IAD Gekirin and Kenroukaku, great for cross-ups (If you haven't noticed yet, Cross-ups are Jam's thing).
Has the same FRC point as ground version. Air Flip FRC reduces the vertical movement and sends Jam very slightly further than normal. Unlike grounded flip FRC, she will still turn around.
Has little to no practical use, and does not have any real effect on IAD flip either.

Jam's other reversal super.

Three frame large grounded uppercut animation. Has strike invincibility during its entire active window.
Launches on hit for a full conversion with a 75% prorate.
Comes with an FRC point on the first hit for safety.
This FRC comes with the added bonus of 150% proration and stagger for big grounded followup damage.
Very stubby range, take care not to get baited, and eye your tension to FRC if necessary.

Jam's inner North Star.

Deals 100 points of damage, regardless of guts, defense or any proration. Very useful to confirm into to make sure that they're dead.
Also a reversal, but considering the 100% tension cost, you should probably never be choosing it over any other option.
Only does one hit on block, but connects into an animation with every hit if it connects.

One of the fastest IKs in the game in both prep time and startup. Coupled with its fast travel and Jam's huge stun output, you can reliably react to a dizzy and just do it.
