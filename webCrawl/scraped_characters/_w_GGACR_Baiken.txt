Overview
Baiken is set apart from the cast due to her guard cancels, which allow her to attack during blockstun without tension. This enables her to break out of pressure and limit the opponent's options, forcing them to play a completely different game against her.
These guard cancels can be performed during hitstop/blockstop, the period of time where characters are frozen as moves make contact to emphasize the hit effects. This means that she can punish moves which are normally safe since the GC's startup occurs during the window where the opponent's move is frozen, plus the remaining active window, plus the move's recovery frames. Each guard cancel allows her to get out of a variety of pressure situations.
Additionally Baiken comes with an excellent set of normals, some very strong conversions and damage, and has a toolkit for nearly every situation. On the flip side, her conversions are quite awkward and some of her best buttons also have very limited cancel routes. Baiken also takes much higher damage than average and can get dizzied pretty quickly, so Baiken players need to play sharp or risk losing fairly quickly. However, that shouldn't matter if she is played sharply, as her tools provide her plenty of opportunities to shut down anything the other player wants to do.
If you love to play careful turtle-characters with strong offensive responses against the right reads, consider picking Baiken up for a try.

 Baiken fights in the mid-range, and bulldogs through the opponent's offense with her free guard-cancel attacks.



Pros
Cons


Free Guard Cancels: Baiken's guard cancels allow her to act during Blockstun, forcing opponents to play cautiously even while on the offensive. Many matchups may require opponents to end pressure early or go for safer but less rewarding options, which allows Baiken to remain a threat even while on the back foot.
Exceptional Damage: With meter, Baiken can convert into extremely powerful and lengthy combos. These combos also have tend to have great corner carry.
Powerful Hitboxes: Notably 2K, S normals, 5H, j.H, j.D, and TatamiGuard:AllStartup:15Recovery:9Advantage:-6 are very disjointed can be very difficult to contest.
The Card of Death: BakuGuard:MidStartup:11Recovery:20Advantage:-3 and its followups can disable the opponent's buttons, take away their movement options, set up an unblockable, and grant full counter-hit combos.
Strong Mixup Tools: YouzansenGuard:High/AirStartup:6Recovery:15+11 after landingAdvantage:-25 instant overhead, throw conversions, a safe 5D, and the ability to reversal out of blocking with her guard cancels give Baiken lots of mixup options.
Tiny Hurtbox: Baiken's short stature makes it difficult for many characters to land Instant Overheads, F-ShikiSometimes known as "Fuzzy Overhead". When you are in blockstun, you can switch high/low blocking, but your blocking animation and hurtbox does not change until you leave blockstun or block another attack. F-Shikis take advantage of this and use overheads that would miss on crouching characters, but not on standing characters.s, or air to ground conversions against her.


Limited Meterless Conversions: Many of Baiken's normals have limited gatlings and depend on close proximity, counterhits, or crouch confirms to convert into combos. Baiken will often want to spend meter on FRC to access her high damage, or depend on difficult techniques such as Kire Tatami.
Unforgiving Execution Barrier: Baiken's best combos require judicious use of techniques like Kire tatami, IADs, Suzuran cancels, and plenty of FRCs. Her corner juggle loops require precision and adjustment for specific situations and hurtboxes.
Low Defense and Dizzy Modifiers: Baiken has one of the lowest defense modifiers in the game, so she pays dearly for her mistakes. She is also easy to stun.




Unique Mechanics
Guard Cancel

Guard Cancel
Baiken can cancel into special moves during blockstop/blockstun. Being able to cancel blockstun into attacks is pretty strong by itself, but Blockstop is a window in which only Baiken can move. This is far more powerful of an ability than it first appears.

ActiveThe active frames of an attack refers to the amount of time an attack can hit the opponent. Frames



InactiveFrames in the middle of multi-hit attacks which cannot hit the opponent, but are after the move has become active at least once. Frames



RecoveryThe recovery of an attack refers to the amount of time an attacker must wait before he may perform another action, even blocking. Frames

5P is a good point-blank poke, and probably Baiken's best tick-throw poke.

It cancels into 2K and can jump cancelled – this allows you to mixup with a low (2K) or high (Youzansen).

Used often in combos as it chains to f.S, 2D, 5H, and can be jump cancelled.
This allows a 2D/Youzansen mix-up from a close blocked hit, and allows Baiken to combo from almost any c.S that hits.
On many standing characters, you can combo c.S to a j.D immediately after jumping. This can lead to a nice knockdown or bigger damage with an FRC.

Incredible normal. Has strong range and a great hitbox.

Strong poke due to the above, and as it can also be jump cancelled.
Only combos to tatami on counter-hit or crouching hit. Can be gatling'd between 2S as well, for extended confirmation time.
Generally deferred to 2D for combo uses.
Similarly to c.S, f.S also combos to a low j.D on many standing hit boxes, which is key for extended range knockdowns/confirms.

One of Baiken's higher damage moves due to its low GB- value. 

Though 5H is not as good as 6H, it is a faster alternative.
Combos into Tatami on the ground and against a low airborne opponent.
From a 5H counter-hit, Baiken can continue the combo with Kabari (chain) from quite far.
Beware using 5H from neutral, because the move only actively hits for one frame and has a large recovery.

Very good meaty as it is +2 normally and can be as much as +10 if meatied perfectly. Take care in meatying this move because it loses grab invincibility during active frames.

Baiken's highest damage normal, this move also has a very low GB-, making it great for combos. 

Special AND jump cancelable (unlike 5H).
It is very slow startup, however, and can be a challenge to place. Usually used to pick up opponent during slide or wall bounce.

Staple move which is just as important as Baiken's guard cancels. These control space, end blockstrings from a distance, and start combos in the corner or with an FRC. Despite being -6, it's generally very difficult to punish this move unless IB'd/SB'd due to how far the opponent gets pushed away. Depending on the spacing when you use it, this move won't make contact immediately, but players who attempt to jump or IAD over it will have difficulty due to how high the initial hitbox reaches.


The air version has some slight variation in use compared to the ground version in neutral, but still the same in combos. Tatami will drop straight down when done in the air, lacking the ground version's blowback, but still serving to cover a large portion of the screen and prevent opponents from rushing in.
In combos, it will still wallbounce if combo'd into properly, and with the FRC, it tends to lead to some of Baiken's most damaging combo strings.

Frighteningly fast overhead when Tiger Knee'd, leading to Baiken's extensive corner damage and knockdown when RC'd. The ability to go into this out of any jump cancellable normal, particularly her 2D, gives you an extremely powerful mixup tool whenever the opponent is in blockstun.
For easier inputs, 923S also works. You may find it easier to do the 923 motion from blockstun. Moves with larger amounts of blockstun, like c.S or the aforementioned 2D are good normals to throw out before attempting this input.

Done higher in the air, it can be used to delay her fall and bait the opponent into attempting a punish. It has landing recovery frames when you do eventually come down from stalling in the air, but these can be cleared by double jumping after a Youzansen if you still have it available.
Has an extremely early and difficult FRC point which comes before the moves goes active, but will slow and change the direction of Baiken's aerial momentum, and has its uses in corner combos.
Extremely unsafe on block, and when TK'd, will leave you wide open if it is blocked. However, you generally won't be getting any reward off of this without meter anyway, so you'll likely be saving this for when you can convert.

Youshijin's main purpose is to launch on grounded hit after a hit confirmation, leading to combos pretty easily. It can serve as an early anti air since its hitbox extends very high, but using it on reaction will get you counter hit. Save it for when you've already established a hit up close.

Do note however that its speed will leave an opening, and those aware can low profile and punish it. Can work as a janky, predictive anti-air since Baiken's hurtbox lowers a bit.

Powerful followup to Kabari, best for people trying to jump-in at you if Kabari whiffs. Has a decent chunk of startup invul, leads to combos on ocassion, and generally a good option for those who are trying to get around the chain. Be cautious as it's very unsafe if baited.

Despite being a guard cancel, this is your main combo ender after corner combos, as Baiken will usually cross herself up in the corner, use the extensive hitstun of 6P > Suzuran > Zakuro to score the knockdown, and cross them back up with another jumping Tatami.
It's also Baiken's main answer to large hitbox jump ins like Johnny, Justice, or Baiken's j.H. Against airdash buttons or opponents performing a very deep jump-in, this will mostly likely whiff, leaving Baiken wide open. Zakuro is best suited to obviously high jump-ins and combos.

Excellent Guard Cancel which crosses up the opponent if performed close enough. Best used against moves with a lot of recovery, allowing Baiken to step in and throw or punish if given enough time. you'll need to exercsise judgment since it doesn't actually have a hitbox.

One of Baiken's most rewarding GCs. 

Hits straight in front of her. Best between slow, beefy hits.
Relatively fast, staggers on hit.
Leads to damage with the FRC, extended stagger on CH.
A good option when the opportunity is recognized, just don't get it baited, though.

Launches high and very untechable on CH, will net a huge reward.

The second follow-up to Baku. Whichever follow-up is used, the opponent is locked out of using the corresponding button for the duration of the applied curse, i.e. using the P follow-up prevents the opponent from using the P button.

The S follow up will cross up.
The D follow up is useful as it locks the opponent out of their Burst.
The H follow up can also be used to prevent the opponent from using standard throws and from teching throws, which is quite effective when applied with the "no jump/dash/backdash" debuff. The opponent will then be prevented from using reversal backdash and reversal throw, and will also be unable to jump out of throw setups or tech throws, massively crippling their defense.
