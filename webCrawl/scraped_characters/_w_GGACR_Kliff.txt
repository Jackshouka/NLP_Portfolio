Overview
The resident geezer with a cleaver, Kliff is a slow but devastating midrange powerhouse. Though he's sluggish, stubby, and has many extended hurtboxes, Kliff is infamous for his ability to confidently ToD most of the cast if he has the meter for it. Due to his long sword normals, he tends to work pretty well at any range closer than half a screen away. He can confirm into his combos incredibly easily, knock down without any trouble, and do OTG pickups in corner carry combos without meter. He has three good lows, multiple instant overheads (including one that works meterlessly), and one of the hardest standing Dusts to see coming in the game. His 6P, Charged 2H, FB Hellish ChargeGuard:MidStartup:22Recovery:68Advantage:-56, and 6H can all do enough dizzy damage to get an opponent seeing birds within a matter of seconds. All in all, Kliff is an offensive monster once he gets close, and his wide range of tricky and high-reward options means he can steal rounds with naught but single confirm. 
On the flip side, Kliff is pretty much always seconds away from death. He's the most extreme risk/reward character in the game, and some of his stronger tools come with brutal downsides. As just one example, using 5D puts Kliff closer to being stunned, and the higher this value, the higher the chance that 2-Steps ForwardGuard:Startup:Recovery:Total 48Advantage: will fail and leave Kliff extremely vulnerable. His neutral is also quite tough, as while he sword normals allow him to poke from far ranges, they also extend out his hurtboxes extremely far. A lack of solid mobility and poor defensive options means that Kliff often has to take big risks to take his turns back. 
Kliff on offense is very strong, but must play smart when on the defensive, as his most potent tools could end up backfiring and costing him the game. If you're looking for a character with a simple yet effective gameplan, massive damage potential, and the ability to quickly flip a match in their favor, Kliff might be what you're looking for.

 Kliff Undersn is a big range, easy damage machine, with a focus on an ability to stun opponents incredibly easily at the risk of screwing things up for himself. Huge risk and huge reward.



Pros
Cons


Obscene Damage With Meter: Point for point, Kliff is the hardest hitting character in the game. Kliff often needs one or two interactions in the corner to instantly end the game, and if he has a full bar to work with and a big starter hits, he's easily capable of performing a ToD.
Deceptively Long Range: Kliff's sword normals have incredibly long reaching hitboxes which can poke or even mix up from half a screen or further. Using these intelligently can allow Kliff to mount threat from far away.
Great Corner Carry: Kliff can put opponents in the corner very easily, even off of stray hits. His combos consistently provide him hard knockdown with generous plus frames, allowing him to mixup how he pleases.
Myriad of Mixup Tools: F-ShikiSometimes known as "Fuzzy Overhead". When you are in blockstun, you can switch high/low blocking, but your blocking animation and hurtbox does not change until you leave blockstun or block another attack. F-Shikis take advantage of this and use overheads that would miss on crouching characters, but not on standing characters., a fast IADAn air dash performed from a standing position as quickly and as low to the ground as possible from a jump. Done by inputting 956 754, and depending on the game, using a dash macro right after a jump., and  Limb SevererGuard:High/Air, AllStartup:14Recovery:26Advantage:-6 (FRC) give Kliff some unusual overhead opportunities. His sweepGuard:LowStartup:7Recovery:21Advantage:-14 is incredibly fast for the range it offers and his standing DustGuard:HighStartup:27Recovery:19Advantage:-6 has an ambiguous startup animation, so Kliff has tons of ways to mix you up no matter what you're prepared for.
Straightforward Okizeme Plan: P Bellowing RoarGuard:AllStartup:16Recovery:4Advantage:+3 is active for nearly half a second and is always plus, giving Kliff laughably easy oki setup.
Small, Floaty Target: Low profile forward dashes, tiny hurtbox at neutral and floaty jump movement can make it very easy for Kliff to avoid setups or offense.
Stun Output: Can have the opponent dizzy off of a single good read or setup, ready to kill them from full health.
Powerful Pressure Exit Tool: 2-Steps Forward is a dodge that is strike invulnerable until the move ends, giving Kliff easy access to an escape option out of gaps in pressure. As an added benefit, its motion allows it to be performed while blocking safely.
Momentum Reverse: Kliff's Gold Burst reward on hit can completely flip the round or even the entire match. On Counter Hit in the corner, his opponent is almost certainly dead, and even in other circumstances Kliff's metered conversion potential with a full bar is extremely scary and can be nearly as decisive.


Limited Mobility: One of the slowest set of dashes in the game, has trouble traversing quickly and escaping the corner. Kliff must either wavedash, dashjump, Skull CrusherGuard:AllStartup:10Recovery:25Advantage:-8 or Nape SaddleGuard:High/AirStartup:28Recovery:4+8 after landingAdvantage:-6 to cover ground, all of which carry risks.
Extended Hurtboxes: Many of Kliff's long range buttons greatly increase his hurtbox size, exposing him to potential counter poke opportunities.
Struggles Against Zoners: Despite his strong toolset, must work extremely hard to work around characters who keep him out with superior spatial control. Zoners in particular give him a hard time, as he has no real answers to what they can do.
Risky Defensive Options: No frame 1 invincible Dead Angle AttackGuard:AllStartup:12Recovery:12Advantage:-2 and two reversal options, both with random elements tied to them, force Kliff to either hold the pressure or bet on high-risk, high-reward options.
Gets Stunned Easily: Tied for the lowest dizzy resistance in the game, Kliff has to factor this in when using 2-Steps Forward or 5D, as they raise his own stun meter which can lead to disaster later on.




Unique Mechanics
Self Stun

Self Stun
Many of Kliff's moves raise his stun level or are affected by it.
Kliff is capable of stunning opponents within a single combo with his high damage and moves with very high base damage and high dizzy modifiers (Such as 6P and 6H). Several moves have varying interactions with his and the opponent's stun level, so that using these moves involved becomes a large consideration of risk vs reward.

5D is a strong dust that is safe on block, but it raises Kliff's own stun level on each use.
2-Steps ForwardGuard:Startup:Recovery:Total 48Advantage: is a dodge that is strike invincible for its entire duration. However, each use increases Kliff's stun level, which increases the chance that the next use of this move will cause Kliff to throw out his back, leaving him free for the opponent to punish.
FB Hellish ChargeGuard:MidStartup:22Recovery:68Advantage:-56 has an offensive dizzy modifier of x50 but it can only be combo'd into in specific situations. It is also not guaranteed to stun the opponent in a combo based on the opponent's stun resistance, and may not work if the opponent was recently stunned already.
All of these moves can contribute to Kliff's style of Russian Roulette. Though he can be difficult to manage defensively, Kliff is capable of dizzying and subsequently KO'ing opponents with no prior interaction, making matches very volatile and cementing Kliff's role as the glass cannon.

The slap chop. Great 5F jab good for pressure starting, combos, or mashing out. Low-key one of Kliff's best normals.

Can be canceled into non-special P and K buttons during recovery frames and on whiff.

Short ranged launcher. Infrequent in neutral, but a useful tool for launching characters mid combo. Most importantly, this move can combo into partially charged 6[P] enabling Kliff to convert somewhat standard hits into his unreasonably high damage 6[H] routes.

Can low crush and occasionally anti-air, but is sadly not throw immune. Use it to go over Slidehead.
Mainly used to combo to 6{P}  > 236S FRC > Fully Charged 6[H] for massive damage. This confirm as a general rule works on much of the cast midscreen but drops on most of the cast in the corner. This along with having other character specific variations and rules means that it's probably worth taking the time to test it out before attempting it on a new character if you are unsure.
Useful spots to use 5k in combos include dashing up and juggling with it after a low j.H, after an impossible dust in the corner, and picking characters back up after a ground slide from FRC 236S (On some characters this can even lead to the 6{P}  > 236S route)
Can be used at the end of longer routes to pop them in the air to enable c.S > Taunt oki. Take note that later the c.S gatling is delayed, the meatier the taunt will be.
Against characters with wider sliding hurtboxes, can be linked meterlessly after 236S in the corner if you are close enough.

Good midrange combo starter and combo ender. Knocks down on air hit, mainly for combo enders, OTG 2S extensions, or a clutch anti-air.

Usually used post 5P/5K at the end of combos to set up taunt oki.
From air confirms, goes straight into OTG 2S > 236S.
Forms a trifecta of IAD'able normals with 5P and 5K.
Combos to IAD j.K on Counter Hit, and IAD j.S on crouching Counter Hit.

Kliff's main ranged ground poke and harassment tool. Great reach and easy confirmation to 2H or 214S.

Very safe when blocked at range.
Usually cancelled into either 2H, 2D, or 236P on block for pushback or frame advantage.
Can confirm from midscreen launches that are too far away to convert into closer buttons.
(e.g. from far j.D, 6P against extended hurtboxes, etc.)
Be careful, as a good portion of the blade becomes part of Kliff's hurtbox.

Can be canceled into specials/gatlings during recovery frames.
Vacuums on air hit for tech traps or 623HxN to tack on as much damage as possible.
Staggers on ground CH, untechable float on CH. Leads to big stuff.
Slow startup can be beneficial for frame traps after P and K normals.
Can convert to big extensions after an air hit 236S.

Ranged, safe on block 5D that confirms to knockdown and damage from anywhere. Roughly the first half of the startup reuses Kliff's crouching sprite, making this move borderline unreactable despite its actual frame data. A critical mixup tool against characters that are too short to get proper fuzzies against.

Airborne on frame 18, allowing Kliff to use it to bait wakeup throws.
Impossible dust leads to guaranteed stun against the majority of the cast in the corner if Kliff has 50 meter for FB chop routes.
The latter end of the active frames can be low profiled if too far away.
Increases Kliff's stun by 10 every use.

Huge stun anti-air. Slow, high recovery, and almost completely vertical, but great right above you.

Very high stun damage, will probably dizzy in two counterhits.
Combos into c.S to knock down, which converts to 2S.
Fully untechable knockdown on CH and leads to 236S, meaning you get huge damage with an FRC.
Combos to 236S meterlessly on ground hit against most midweights. Leads to frame perfect 236S FRC 6[H] near the corner.
Only gatlings if not charged.
Gatling Options: c.S, f.S, 2S, 5H, 2H, 5D, 2D


When partially charged, it gets fully untechable launch on hit, leading to guaranteed conversions. Will autocorrect if released properly. Kliff's real dizzy punish starter.

Still upper body invul during the charge, can be useful to hold it to go under moves like Order Sol's Rock It.
Most often used post dizzy to do stronger conversions from 236S FRC.
Loses the ability to gatling when charged, but can still special/super cancel.
Occasionally still useful as an anti-air, but it has significantly more recovery than uncharged.
Combos from 5K midscreen, leading to 236S FRC 6[H] confirms. Also works in the corner, but is far more character limited. (Check the combo section for more on this)

If it weren't for FB Chop, then max charged 6P would be the highest stun damage move in the game.

4.5 dizzy modifier and 40 base damage means a pretty high dizzy chance.
Otherwise functionally identical to partial charge 6{P}.

Big, slow-ass overhead that hits more often than it should. Head-splitting damage combo starter and occasional mixup normal. People will forget to air FD against this.

Staggers on hit, special cancellable for conversion or to make it safe with 236P.
Leads to extensive damage and will drastically raise their dizzy level even with its slight prorate.
Will sometimes come in clutch if you don't OS your throw with another normal.
Don't whiff this move.

Partial charge is a dizzy punish starter which offloads damage immediately as opposed to 6{P, but generally leads to less damage overall. 

Same stagger as uncharged, but 20% more damage means more dizzy and greater output.
Even a basic 6{H}  > 236S will deal a huge chunk.
Used post 236S, won't connect to anything else unless you use point blank 623H or Reflex Roar, or you're against Johnny. Best used here if it'll kill.

Max charge is 200 base damage. Will generally score 80-180 damage mid combo. Possible to get 1-3 per combo with meter. Touch of Death Time >:)

Almost fully untechable floor bounce on hit for (delayed) 214K or 236S followups.
Requires an air hit/floated 236S FRC that leads to the corner in order to combo into, but is always desirable if possible.
Most commonly done post-dizzy.
Too slow to be used as a combo starter out of a FB Chop against players who mash out, but might work if you score a dizzy off of a stray hit.
Post FB Chop, if you have 50% meter, you can FRC and do this immediately if it'll kill and they still have a burst.
(Generally) Don't use this in neutral.

Vital combo tool that hits and removes OTG. Ignores the rules. 

Predominantly combos to 236S for KD/extension, and 5H for tech traps or character specific conversions.
Kliff's hop makes this an excellent low crush and frame trap tool.
Fairly slow button, will not combo from P or K normals.
Floats up slightly on OTG hit. Can link a 5P/5K deep in the corner.

Low hitting threat from a range that only one other character can similarly threaten at. Primarily a combo tool out of S normals.

Will often tag people retreating or mis-approximating its reach.
Combos to 214S from almost anywhere but tip range, and into pressure and potential combo extension with 236P.
Will get tagged if it whiffs or there's another hitbox in the way when it extends.
Only gatlings if not charged.
Gatling Options: 5D, 2D


Partial charged 2H is easy, burst safe corner combo fodder.

Staggers on normal hit for easier confirms into 214K, 236S, or 236236H.
Loops after a 236S FRC by causing wallstick against an airborne opponent.

Max charged 2H is rarely used, but causes a wallbounce on hit.

Higher damage, but actually slightly harder to confirm than 2{H}.
Not known to have combo use, as 6[H] is preferable at the time it takes to combo this.
Still confirms into 236S and 236236H. Might still confirm into 2S.

Oh me oh my. 7F low profile sweep with incredible range. Kliff's best normal, possibly the best sweep in the game.

Shifts Kliff's hurtbox and hitbox forward away from his collision box, letting him go *around* some moves.
This can lead to janky and confusing situations during an opponent's approach as Kliff will appear to be behind opponents in some scenarios.
Cancelled into Taunt for oki on hit, and into 236P for frame advantage or a conversion.
Links to 2S on CH. Works on normal hit against  May,  Baiken,  Jam,  Anji,  I-No,  Kliff, and  A.B.A.

Great air-to-air and jumping anti-air. One of Kliff's few safe air options in exchange for having the worst range (relatively).

Self cancellable and low recovery, making it great for closer range air wars
Combos into j.S for solid damage.
Mostly used while rising to catch jumps and other jump moves, and OS'd with j.H for airthrow attempts.

Great, low-reaching normal used for hitting right below Kliff, safejumps, instant overheads, and fuzzy guards. The staple Kliff mixup tool. 

Go-to normal out of airdashes and leads to some nasty mixup situations. It doesn't have much horizontal range, so it's mainly used when you've already conditioned or forced the opponent to block.
Sometimes used for air confirms, particularly to lead into j.41236S or j.236D confirms.
Leads to significant damage out of IADs (and IOHs with meter).
Can be used for a tick throw by whiffing j.P afterwards, or other delayed fall attacks.

Decent air-to-air normal at range. Can hit deceptively deep. Combos into j.H for big conversions.

Works as a safejump (off j.41236S), fuzzy setup, and sometimes an IOH after j.D FDC right off the ground.
Big hurtbox extension. Avoid using it too closely if they're not already blocking.
Due to Kliff's slow fall speed, combined with this move's more subtle startup animation, you can hit after a somewhat deep j.K right before hitting the ground, and it becomes very ambiguous between it and 2K.

Large, slow attack which can launch and cross up, hitting mainly behind Kliff on startup. Extremely strong as an air to air and as an air to ground because of its large hitbox, and a vital part of many important confirms. Due to its massive bully potential but specific weaknesses and counterplay, this button is overall one of Kliff's most important air normals to understand both for the Kliff player and the opponent. 

Launches during the latter half of its active frames. This is when the hitbox is generally between directly below Kliff or in front of him.
Big rewards on hit, and you almost always get some sort of confirm, but there are many different routes and they can change significantly based on how the move connects.
Extremely large extended hurtbox. This allows many characters to tag it with a relatively long range 6p at neutral so be careful when using this move against players that know how to work around it. Additionally, if you are concerned about getting whiff punished for missed airgrabs, make sure to OS your airthrow with j.P.
Will always have a gap when chained into on block that can be reversal'd through (e.g. j.S > j.H is not airtight.) This window can actually work in your favor as it may tag players who buffer inputs during blockstun.
Can also be used as an instant overhead, despite appearances. If executed perfectly, it hits at a blazing fast 13 frames, and sets up all sorts of damaging conversions with or without meter. See here for an overview of how it works.


Requires some situational awareness for optimal use:

Hit as a crossup or early: keeps the opponent grounded. Confirm into 5P/c.S on landing for grounded confirms or 5K for a launch if close enough.
Hit later or at the launch side during a combo: launches opponents for generally big damage. Huge damage when hit as low as possible.
Counter hit: Fully untechable launch. You can confirm an OTG 2S from any height air counter hit, making counter hit air to air confirms extremely consistent. If you can manage to confirm into a juggle instead and thus avoid the OTG 2S proration, prepare to watch your opponent melt.
Non-launch grounded Counter hit: Gains a large amount of untechable time, making the followup confirm much easier.

Stalls Kliff's air momentum before plummeting. Used to bait anti airs, throws, and some reversals. Nearly uncontestable, but horribly unsafe if you miss.

Easy damage confirms in the corner, smaller things midscreen. Can begin 6[H] confirms.
Can be FRC'd or FDC'd before it starts. The FRC will maintain downwards momentum, but FDC will cause Kliff to float upwards very slowly.
This FDC can be done with a j.D right off the ground into a minimum 15f .S IOH.
Will always retain its landing recovery unless you (F)RC and use a different jumping special move before you hit the ground.
This means it's better to (F)RC and airdash and/or use j.41236S and then do something on landing if they're not conditioned to attempt an Anti-Air.

Not invincible until frame 5, must be timed correctly.

Kliff's replacement for a standard character's dash. An incredibly important tool for Kliff with unique properties that give it use cases in every matchup.
For starters, unlike the Step Dash that  Johnny has, Kliff's can be cancelled into attacks at any point. This allows Kliff to incorporate dash momentum into grounded combo starters and aids in his approach as well. Important to note, if Kliff's dash is cancelled into an attack before he begins to move forward, he will not gain momentum on the ground, so timing is key for certain corner combos!
Even more importantly, Kliff's dash has a large amount of Low ProfileWhen a character's hurtbox is entirely beneath an opponent's attack. This can be caused by crouching, certain moves, and being short., the exact same amount of it as  Faust crawling! This allows Kliff to slip under many projectiles and attacks, and gives him a lot of ways to anti-air and sneak under his opponent's offense. 
Advanced Usage: Utilizing the low profile that Kliff's Step Dash provides combined with Slashback can allow Kliff to automatically time Slashbacks out of it! This is a powerful technique against moves like  Baiken's KabariGuard:MidStartup:20Recovery:15Advantage:+2, where Kliff can dash under the initial active frames just fine, but the late frames frequently hit him out of the recovery of his dash or the startup of another normal. By Slashbacking out of the dash instead, Kliff will stand up and it will automatically time itself. This can also be used against slow and/or large lingering projectiles, and against higher jump-ins.

Bouncing, multi-hit projectile which doesn't go away when Kliff gets hit. Who knew that calling somebody an idiot made for such good oki?

Can give Kliff meterless conversions off of Instant Overhead j.K/j.S when used.
Works best off of 2D or c.S knockdown.
Can cut down the recovery significantly by canceling into FD or an attacking from 62F onwards.
The last kana randomly spawns doubled in size for four times the damage.
Easily jumped over, but will generally force the opponent to make a decision when used at neutral. Each kana can be cancelled out by other projectiles.
Since this is a taunt it will give the opponent some tension. Make sure not to dial it in after winning a round and give the opponent 50 meter for the next one.

Lesser dragon-roar Fried Egg. Excellent oki tool at +3, and good in pressure. 

When meatied or FRC'd, it's possible to gain nearly 30 frames of advantage.
Decimates one hit of other projectiles, can help negate other zoners' games.
Serves as a decent poke, but awful on whiff.
Good for conversions or pressure continuation after 2D with an FRC.
When used after 2D, an airdash will allow you to convert if the 2D hit, or continue pressure if it was blocked.

Greater dragon-roar Fried Egg. Enormous hitbox that deals great damage and causes floor slide for conversions or oki. Bread and Butter combo tool.

Horribly unsafe on block and whiff unless FRC'd.
Universal combos after FRC. Used in all of Kliff's major loops.
Meterless conversions if hit against an airborne opponent, notably after 6{P} .
The FRCs on these moves are vital to playing Kliff effectively. Learn them.

Transport attack, good in combos and as a (whiff) punish due to its large hitbox, speed, and range. Very difficult to punish.

Will beat many specific moves because of multiple hits, breaking through armor and riskier long range moves (e.g: Potemkin's slidehead and hammerfall).
Airborne from frame 7, will go over some things.
Unsafe on block, and in counterhit state for almost the entire duration, but you can still get away with this on block fairly frequently.
Leads to a mixup and lets Kliff get in when RC'd on block. Save yourself if the opponent can punish you consistently.
Combos into 2S unless you hit extremely far away.
Will usually not knock down an airborne opponent: they'll be able to tech the last hit and punish you.

Air drill. Leads to air knockdowns when close enough to the ground, or Tiger Knee'd.

Best near the corner at low height since it can combo into 2S.
Can confirm off of an air hit 236S near the corner to get back in and set up oki.
Very unsafe and not useful in neutral, but can be FRC'd when the active window ends. Don't whiff.
You'll want to know this FRC well, as occasionally you'll get sideswapped when attempting a j.41236S.
Don't use this against grounded opponents unless you get a character specific confirm or have the meter to (F)RC.

Vault. Fullscreen mixup and callout tool, knocks down. Hits overhead, and will crossup depending on position.

Not great when blocked. Throw punishable. Can also be easily tagged in the air, as it only goes active as Kliff passes the apex of his arc.
Works as a character specific alternative to 236S after an OTG 2S against characters that you want to stay in against when you don't have them near the corner.
Can convert into 2s on high air hits.
FRC > j.41236S or j.H can be used for tricks, but it's not the best use of meter due to Kliff's slow fall speed.
Cancelling taunt into this can give you some decent options, as taunt will usually cover the recovery.

The Pinnacle of Anti-Airs. Gigantic, completely disjointed hitbox which smacks opponents almost anywhere above you.

Mostly useful at the end of a combo for tacking on as many hits as possible. Very burst safe, too.
The lengthy recovery and varying number of hits can put Kliff in an awkward situation.
Kliff can move back or forth slightly while mashing more hits.
If this clashes while mashing, you may get a 6H which will sometimes tag opponents that are ill-prepared.
Will vacuum even when they tech and requires FD to airblock, so it can repeatedly reset unaware opponents.
If you're on the receiving end of this move, tech and hold FD until you safely touch the ground.

NOTE: This attack groups hitboxes in trios.
E.G: [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,1,2]...
Minimum number of hits is 7 (42F).
The "finishing attack" is hitbox #3.

One of Kliff's defining moves in which he just steps to the side. Is strike invul for its entire duration. Can only be punished with throw.

Can either be followed up with Hellish Charge to put a hitbox out, or you can just wait for the recovery to end and grab or smack a button.
Works as a very risky reversal on wakeup, or use on oki to bait the reversals.
Great against lengthy moves you can react to, like supers, and can follow up with Chop or FB Chop for a huge punish.
Can be OS'd against and will lose to safejump > land > throw OS.
The closer you are to being dizzied and the more often you use it, the more chances it has of failing, which will get you killed.
This move cannot be canceled into.
Kliff 214P adds 10.24 stun to Kliff, regardless of whether or not you do a follow-up.
Kliff 214P does not increase Kliff's stun when it triggers Back Break state. It only increases stun when Kliff successfully dodges.
Throwing out Kliff's back
Under normal conditions, that is to say, you only input 214P in that order:

When Kliff's stun is less than 1/4 of his max stun, 214P is guaranteed to work
When Kliff's stun is between 1/4 (inclusive) and 1/2 (exclusive) of his max stun, he has a 1/8th chance to fail and break his back
When Kliff's stun is between 1/2 (inclusive) and 3/4 (exclusive) of his max stun, he has a 1/4th chance to fail and break his back
When Kliff's stun is greater than or equal to 3/4 of his max stun, he has a 1/2 chance to fail and break his back
Under abnormal conditions, and the condition appears to be whether or not you kara-cancel into 214P (even though you cannot cancel into it...?):

When Kliff's stun is less than 1/4 of his max stun, 214P is guaranteed to work
When Kliff's stun is between 1/4 (inclusive) and 1/2 (exclusive), 214P has a 1/4 chance to fail and break his back
When Kliff's stun is between 1/2 (inclusive) and 3/4 (exclusive), Kliff has a 1/2 chance to fail and break his back
When Kliff's stun is greater than or equal to 3/4 of his max stun, Kliff has a 3/4 chance to fail and break his back
Note: The reason "Max Stun" is used here instead of Kliff's default stun rating of 50, is because the dodge checks the maximum value, which can be modified. Check out the [Bear Stun] explanation for more details.

Kliff's main air combo knockdown tool. Strong all around move, both as a combo starter and ender.

Hits overhead, can cross up while cutting Kliff's horizontal momentum, and stalls in the air for occasional fakeouts.
Leads to a safejump with fuzzy guard setups. Has four(?) different shockwave sizes, growing larger the higher Kliff is when he initiates the move.
Leads to big damage, or guaranteed dizzy setups in the corner on hit with meter.
Can be difficult to punish due to pushback.
The second hit can cancel out other projectiles, keeping Kliff safe against things like Eddie's drills.
FRC right before it goes active to fake out into a throw or low.
Comes with the weakness of being out prioritized by j.214S if you get crossed under, which is *horribly* unsafe on whiff. Always keep the opponent's position in mind.
Can be punished by having the first hit air blocked and the second hit jumped over.
This move is overall one of Kliff's more important ones. Can be very frustrating to deal with if the opponent is not familiar with it.

Almost guaranteed stun move (x50 modifier!). Getting tagged by this is one of the most frustrating things in the game. First you stun them, then you win.

Too slow to use at neutral, but can be combo'd into. Can work as a very slow punish in some instances.
Significantly less invuln than the meterless version.
Despite the ludicrously high dizzy modifier, there are many instances where the dizzy is not guaranteed. Use as early in a combo as possible when setting up.
Tends to work best near the corner, out of throw, airthrow, j.41236, Impossible Dust, and CH Gold Burst.
Becomes riskier to attempt the more you've been hit or attempted to dodge/214P. Be absolutely certain that you won't throw out your back when combo'ing into this.
Will perform the coughing animation regardless of hit or block/whiff. Won't give you enough time to start a combo with 6[H] unless you RC it. Kliff will still get ridiculous punishes afterwards regardless.

Not fully invul. Kliff will get tagged before it goes active if he sticks his hand into a hitbox. Otherwise one of Kliff's best uses of 50 meter.

1~22F Strike1~??F Throw 



Extremely slow reversal that's invincible until it starts, but is very hit or miss if it connects.

Can be charged after the flash for more hits. Charging will also extend its throw invincibility until the button is released.
0F after the first hit, so good in gaps against moves with a lot of recovery.
Hits at random and can knock them any given distance away from you. Can knock targets out of the hit zone and make itself completely vulnerable on hit.
If the opponent is sucked in on the last hit, it can combo into 2S > 236S after the knockdown.

Kliff's incredibly long IK preparation makes this rather impractical. FB Hellish Charge RC can give enough time to use this move, but mashing out beforehand is not particularly difficult. Generally too slow to be much use.
