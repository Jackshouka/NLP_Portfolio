Overview
Dizzy is mobile zoning character that relies on a wide variety of summons to set the pace of the match.
In neutral, she's one of the most frustrating characters to pin down thanks to her fast double airdash, long-range normals, and anti-airs. Once she gets her projectile game started, Dizzy thrives at forcing the opponent into uncomfortable choices that let her establish more and more control. Her multitude of summons and specials allow Dizzy to set the pace through lockdown and covering common attack angles. Summons can notably be used to set up psuedo-unblockables and can catch reversal attempts, which allows Dizzy to force her way through attempts at disrespecting her offense. Once she finds a knockdown to start and cover her offense, Dizzy has a huge number of brutal mixups at her disposal that range from high-lows, left-rights, fuzzies, tick throws, frame traps, and unblockables. Her incredible damage potential also means she will end up taking those mixups very far. 
This is all offset by Dizzy's very poor tools when stuck in pressure. She has only one subpar metered reversal, an average backdash and Dead Angle, and a bad defense and stun modifier. Combine this with slow normals and overall weak standalone hit and hurtboxes, and Dizzy can quickly see her lifebar drained and her stun way up. Dizzy requires  solid defense and awareness of when to use her high mobility to get out of an opponent's offense, lest she be quick to fall apart. 
If you can handle her limited defensive options and gain a strong grasp of her offensive gameplan, Dizzy is very good at suffocating her opponents.

 Dizzy is a highly mobile character with a wide variety of summons and projectiles that she sets up for future return.



Pros
Cons


Oki Goddess: With setup, Dizzy has access to every form of mixup. She can perform  high/lows, cross-ups, frame traps, instant overheads, and tick throws while blowing through nearly every reversal option in the game. To sweeten the deal, her throw is tied for the second longest range in the game, and leads to the same terrifying mix. Once she gets her snowball is rolling, it can be very hard to stop her.
Summon Defense: When summons are out, Dizzy is hard to attack. Fish can eat a hit for her, or even continue attacking after Dizzy is hit. Spears can be fired while Dizzy is blocking. FB Bubble can be used to checkmate the opponent. Thanks to these, she can initiate RPSRock Paper ScissorsA situation wherein an attacker and a defender have options that only beat certain responses from their opponent. For example, on wakeup a defending opponent may use a reversal to stop an attacker from using an attack, but the attacker can also block to defeat the reversal. If the attacker blocks, the defender can use the opportunity to take the offensive. while on the back foot.
Space Control: Thanks to her aforementioned summon defense, Along with Scythes, Bubbles and FB Spears, Dizzy can effectively wall out opponents. This is further accentuated by her mobility, and access to the only air-throw-invulnerable normalGuard:High/AirStartup:7Recovery:8Advantage: in the game.
Value from 25 Meter: Options like Ice SpkeGuard:AllStartup:14Recovery:42Advantage:-23 FRC, FB BubbleGuard:Startup:9Recovery:Total 25Advantage:, and FB KnivesGuard:AllStartup:31Recovery:Total 47Advantage: are very flexible and strong. With them, Dizzy can instill fear in the opponent, or access powerful okizeme.
Exceptional Mobility: Dizzy's extreme dash acceleration, fast jump, and double airdash allow her to run circles around most of the cast.
High Damage: Dizzy has access to good overall damage which becomes exceptional with setups and resources.


Poor Defense: Dizzy's buttons are below average on defense, and her reversal superGuard:ThrowStartup:9+4Recovery:14Advantage: sucks. This is made worse by her having 4th lowest health in the game, as well as the lowest stun resistance.
Chunky Hurtboxes: Her big hurtboxes make Dizzy a large target which exacerbates her issues on defense. Of particular note is how her FD Jump hurtbox is one of the larger ones in the game.
Some Assembly Required: Being a setup character, it can be difficult for her to find room to get started against fast characters, or characters that control a lot of space.
Air Knockdowns: Dizzy can't reliably score a KD against airborne opponents.




Unique Mechanics
Fish

Fish  
Dizzy can summon five variations of fish which move forward and absorb a single hit for her. Fish enable Dizzy's okizeme game and help her control space.  Only one fish may be active at any time.  If Dizzy is hit the fish stay out, and they can be "programmed" to attack a 2nd time in any variation by hitting the corresponding button during startup.

StartupThe time before an attack is active including the first active frame. For example, an attack with 10F startup means the attack will do nothing for 9 frames, then hit the opponent on the 10th frame. frames



ActiveThe active frames of an attack refers to the amount of time an attack can hit the opponent. Frames



InactiveFrames in the middle of multi-hit attacks which cannot hit the opponent, but are after the move has become active at least once. Frames



RecoveryThe recovery of an attack refers to the amount of time an attacker must wait before he may perform another action, even blocking. Frames

Very situational, atypical f.S. Can be crouched by most of the cast except for Potemkin, and is awful on whiff. Learning to judge the proximity so you don't actually get this instead of c.S is very important. f.S is generally limited to anti-airs (particularly against IADs) or air combos. 
f.S is multihit, which makes it useful as a counterpoke against moves with armor (most notably Potemkin's Hammerfall) and allows it to crank up the gravity scaling during combos, which makes it a prime tool when trying to combo into Ice Spike.

A slow but high damaging move that's mostly used in strings to combo from other normals into 2H, 2D,  or ice spike depending on the range or in block strings as it is -4 at worst and can be made even safer at a distance.  It can also work as a frametrap from 2K as that leaves a gap of exactly one frame, however be careful as this mean the same situation on hit won't combo if they're at 5H's tip range
The move can also sort of work as a poke in the same way as other character's f.S however it comes with risks since the move extends Dizzy's hurtbox before the hitbox comes out and it's quite slow.

A typical 5D but its range can catch opponents offguard, especially when obscured by summons and thanks to it barely animating at the start it can be hard for some people to react to it. Despite it being -12 the range and the amount of active frames can make it deceptively safe.
It sets up for a normal air juggle in midscreen and a bubble loop in the corner thanks to impossible dust, however despite this it doesn't see much use as Dizzy has a lot of faster high/low mixups to use instead

1~14F Upper Body

Dizzy's 6P works a bit different than most other character's 6P. It has some upper body invul but this is usually outshined by her 2S as an anti airs and on hit it launches the opponent into a wallbounce that at best can be comboed into ice spike for a knockdown.
Where it shines is in fish combos in the corner where things like 6P -> [fish hits] -> 421S can lead into a bubbleloop because of the 6P launches them and the fish hit keeping them in place for the initial hitbox on 421S to hit them.

Massive two-hit disjointed launcher that's also really active giving it some situational use against Slayer's backdash however this also means it's horribly unsafe on whiff. 
Builds a lot of guardbar and has a 3 frame FRC starting at both of its active frames, however this is both outshined by 2H FRC or just simply by 6H on its own being both jump and special cancellable. 
It staggers on CH but the range it hits at and the pushback usually makes this awkward to take advantage of.

Excellent range for its speed, but 1 frame slower than her 5P or c.S as an abare.
Although its 70% proration it has the nice benefit of letting you gatling it into itself which can make it easier to confirm into a combo. Just beware that on it's own it won't combo into 2D due to it's lower attack level, so make sure to gatling into at least 2K/5K before that.
In tick-throw situations its low attack level has the benefit of causing the interaction to happen faster due to it's low blockstun and hitstop

Her main ground footsies tool along with 5K. Fast, low-hitting, good range, with good combo options, this is one of her most useful normals. 
Dizzy's main low in her low/high mixups. Combos into both 2H and 2D as long as they're in range, with the only problem being that 2K into 5H sometimes doesn't combo at the tip because of characters hitstun reeling animation.
Has 80% initial proration, so it's not ideal as a punisher use 5K for that.

Dizzy's main AA normal equivalent to other characters' 6P. Has a strong, really vertical disjointed hitbox and thanks to the move requiring a down input your hurtbox is naturally lowered before this comes out, however the hitbox being mostly vertical also means it can lose to some more horizontally disjointed moves. 
As with most of Dizzy's anti-airs it doesn't really lead into a knockdown due to her lack of air knockdown moves.

The main knockdown you should be going for but also has the shortest range of Dizzy's 3 knockdown options 2H 2D 236H. 
It knocks down and has extended cancel window letting delay cancel K and D fish to hit make them both hit as meaty as you want and on block the cancel window also lets you frametrap people with ice spike, however do note that the actual move has a lot of recovery so on it's own it's still really unsafe both on block and especially on whiff. As a bonus the way that 2H slightly launches people up in the air means that 2H > 236H will make you more advantageous than normal
It also has some use as a CH fisher as the move is still relatively fast and leads into big combos on CH while also building a lot of stun thanks to its 1.5x stun modifier. The FRC compliments this by having an FRC window on the first active frame that lasts 3 frames, which thanks to this move being level 5 means it will build a lot of guard gauge while also being +18 on normal block.

Enormous sweep. While it doesn't have the same delayed cancel window with 2H it makes up for it by being the second longest knockdown option of her 3 options 2H 2D 236H. Additionally it is also jump cancellable which can be use to circumvent the move's frame advantage and situationally punish people who were pressing buttons expecting to catch the startup of a special. 
In neutral it also has some use as the move is fairly disjointed and it's really low profile even during part of it's recovery, however beware as the recovery on whiff is still really long. This also has some use in fish setups where the disjoint and low profile can be used against certain reversals that are otherwise harder to bait like Sol Volcanic Viper or Jam's powered up Kenroukaku, on top of this there is also setups that use the move's launch in conjunction with the fish to start bubble loops.

Extremely fast and lingering hitbox, but short ranged air normal. Tied with a few others at frame 4.

Retracts Dizzy's otherwise quite large air hurtbox, so useful for escaping; has a smaller early jumping hurtbox than jump > FD.
Sometimes works as a jump-in, particularly deep.
Good for air conversions from the ground.
Fastest air normal makes it useful for popping Bubbles immediately after setting them.
So fast that it goes active during an air tech's invincibility frames, functionally making it an air reversal.

Wing Blades. An air normal which does it all. Wide swinging attack which covers an arc from behind Dizzy to up and in front.

Hits so low that it generally hits opponents even at IAD height, though mind this will cross up outside the corner.
Completely throw invincible, so it can be used to escape, fall on opponents, and attack with airdashes without fear of opponent's air throw.
Recovers in the air if done immediately out of an airdash, allowing Dizzy another airdash or landing into 2K or 2D for a high/low mixup.
Hits extremely deep, often requiring opponents to press their anti-air attack extremely early, and making it very difficult to anti-air as a falling cross-up.
Gatlings into j.P which can be useful in airdash strings.
Fastest IAD  j.2S hits vs crouching on frame 26 against every character except Anji, Bridget, Faust, I-no, Kliff, and Zappa, where it whiffs entirely.

One of the few level 5 air normals in the game—exceptional for its high damage, long block stun, excellent and untech-time.

Big amount of untechable time on air counter hit if you score against another air attack.
High damage and high untech make it excellent in combos, and it's a core part of her Bubble loop combos.
Long amount of blockstun for easy conversions or pressure extension, and make it generally safe against defensive throws even if the opponent instant blocks it.
Leads to land > rejump j.P instant overheads in setups.
Hits very low to the ground, but only when spaced out. Very susceptible to whiffing when too close due to its point blank dead zone.
Despite its large hitbox, it has a large hurtbox.

High Damage, far reaching, two hit combo-ender which sends them up and away.

Covers an enormous amount of space, especially with an air dash or superjump, allowing Dizzy to hit areas that other characters have difficulty covering.
Can be used with a superjump to catch techs and high airdashes.
Launches on hit, but can have limited conversion options due to the standard j.D landing recovery.
Can be comboed after a counterhit if only one of the hits connects, but this is situational.
Excellent air combo ender because putting the opponent so high can give Dizzy more time to summon. However, mind that it has shorter horizontal range than j.H in its early active frames, which can occasionally cause it to drop from j.S gatlings.

Only shorter than Potemkin and Justice for normal throw range. Easily one of the best throws in the game. 
While on the surface this looks like a typical throw, the fact that it immediately makes Dizzy's fish disappear and refresh the cooldown as they're getting knocked down while also giving Dizzy enough frame advantage to resummon her fish makes this exceptionally strong for Dizzy. To top it all off the stagger on D fish gives her a really reliable way to combo into the throw and loop her oki.
It can also lead to a small combo anywhere on screen, however in midscreen doing a combo means you have to give up some of the oki unless you're willing to spend 25% to FRC the icespike. It is also possible to combo the throw into bubble, as the throw doesn't make Dizzy's bubble disappear, which depending on the height can lead to a knockdown.

Important tool because many of Dizzy's summons can be answered by jumping.

Leads to similar combos as a ground throw, but note at midstage it can leave them very far or be techable depending on height. Combo into D-Ice Spike when very far for a knockdown.
Because the wall bounce can cause so much variance in terms of spacing, a variety of confirms are needed. Very low air throws may not be comboable in the corner.
Unsummons fish and spear like her ground throw.
Can leave opponents so close to Dizzy that they can throw her on wakeup if you don't account for it.

Average Dead Angle on paper, but extremely useful as it covers one of Dizzy's main weaknesses, defense.

Will wallbounce if near a corner.
Techbable if it's not a counterhit.
Like most DAAs, it's unsafe on block, and can be low profiled.

Below the knees invul, allows Dizzy to dash over many lows, including Potemkin's Slidehead. However it should be noted that the high profile is weaker during the first few frames of the dash.
Thanks to her extremely fast dash acceleration she can get more range out of her grounded pokes

Dizzy's taunt is a really peculiar move because not only does it have a grounded unblockable hitbox, that can be airblocked with FD, its startup is also determined by which of the three voice sets the game decided to randomly pick at the start of the match, depending on which one the game chooses you might have to hit her taunt meaty for it to be possible to cancel it during hitstun, as the window where it can be cancelled into anything but movement is always on frame 62.
This means that version B needs to hit fairly meaty where as version C just needs to hit meaty by a few frames.
It doesn't really have any practical use though, as it's either too slow and everyone can simply crouch under it. there is however a small exception where a few characters:  Anji, Axl, Dizzy, I-no, Justice, Potemkin, and Slayer can get hit on wake-up even if they're holding downback, because their hurtbox during the in-between frames of going to crouch is high enough to still get, however this can be avoided by doing anything that skips said in-between frames like holding FD down-back or just doing most crouching normals. So in the end even with a special setup for this, all of this just turns it into a really simple knowledge check. Dizzy has options to cover this, but they are essentially all worse than just doing a normal fish mixup.

The infamous Ice Spike. Primary combo ender, extremely fast ranged for its range, fantastic launch, powerful frame trap when backed by FRC, and +8 to +9 when FRCed for pressure resets. Dizzy's best use of meter.

Hits a bit farther than round start distance.
Leads to powerful fish oki in the corner. At midscreen it requires an FRC to both set a summon and get an unjumpable mixup.
Without the FRC, unsafe on block, and unsafe if properly bursted. Take caution.
FRC is late enough to confirm the situation before doing it.
One of the hardest FRCs in the game due to the long delay between the button press and the FRC window, and one of Dizzy's highest execution staple techniques. Practice hard.
Gives a huge launch of counterhit leading to big damage.
It has 85% forced proration, but very high base damage.

D is a fullscreen version with similar effects on hit, but more for sniping and punishing than combos. A key component of Dizzy's space control.

Hits at twice the distance of H icicle.
Has the same FRC as the H version, but mostly use to allow for better oki because the distance makes comboing from it difficult outside of a laser fish to back it up.
Very good for sniping opponents full screen to hit them out of their own summons or to punish full-screen options.
Juggles after air throw or H fish.
The extremely long range can make it tricky to aim because of the way the screen zooms out when opponents are at a distance.

Fish. Multi-purpose summon/assist which covers various angles and changes its attack patterns based on the button(s) input. Each button behaves differently, and Dizzy can input 1-2 versions per use, with the fish performing its attacks in sequence. The cornerstone of Dizzy's oki and pressure game.

Stays out if Dizzy is hit but not if she is thrown. Will sponge a hit for Dizzy, making her pressure very tight and reversal safe when performed properly.
A followup input behaves from the previous input's position. E.g. If P~P Fish is performed, it will home in, attack, and home in again.
The follow-up move must be inputted during Dizzy's recovery frames.
After the fish is gone, there's a 108F delay to use it again
BIT NG appears above Dizzy's tension gauge when Fish is unavailable.
Dizzy is in CH state until the move ends; Fish is guaranteed to come out from frame 35 and onwards.

P version bites twice and homes in from around 60% of the screen. Best used for oki.

Best used at closer range, particularly after a small dash in post knockdown.
Allows for setup for other summons: (214P~H, 421[S], 236K, ]S[).

K version bites three times in quick succession. Homes in at up to around 1 character length of the screen. Also great for oki.

Sets up combos due to the multiple hits.
Expanded blockstun also might give you multiple mixup opportunities.

S is a delayed rising, horizontal laser. Mainly for air coverage, neutral, and forcing opponents to sit.

Delaying the second input until the last 4 frames changes the order and changes properties of the fish's attacks, commonly noted as #S or "Glitch Fish"
Hits fullscreen. Useful at range. The laser continues upwards to the top of the screen.
Wallsticks on hit for setup and confirmation, or just getting them away from you.
Also useful on oki for opponents who attempt to jump out.

H is similar to S Fish's laser, but stays closer to the ground. Good for oki and defense.

Delaying the second input until the last 4 frames reverses the order and changes the properties of the the fish's attacks, commonly noted as #H or "Glitch Fish"
Covers the entire ground, leaving it up to you to react to air escape attempts.
Has a similar startup delay to the S version.
Avoid using up close due to being easier to get around and punish.

D is the Big Slow Bite. Great for oki and defense.

Staggers on hit, leads to bigger confirms.
Level 6 attack, great for blockstun, especially if they're too frightened to try to escape.

Commonly referred to as knife.

The rising orb is a launcher and hitting with this portion of the move leads to Dizzy's signature "Bubble Loop," one of Dizzy's highest damage combos.
Can be delayed by holding down [S]. Note that because the button must be held down, Dizzy loses access to the button, and so cannot use moves like c.S or  j.2S.
Covers the space above and slightly in front of Dizzy as an anti-air, which catch opponents after an air tech, and can prevent opponents from IADing or jumping at her if done on prediction.
First hit whiffs vs crouch blocking opponents, except Potemkin.
The second hit is a homing attack, which aims at wherever the opponent was when S was released. The hitbox is a bit small and the tracking is iffy, so it can whiff in unexpected situations.
The second hit is easier to avoid if the opponent moves perpendicular to the angle of the shot. At a distance this generally means jumping.
Dizzy can tandem with the held homing attack to hold the opponent in place a very long time, and sometimes even summon a fish on them.
Disappears if Dizzy is hit, but not if Dizzy blocks.
Held knives can be used to counterattack while blocking, like a makeshift Dead Angle Attack. To play around this, the opponent generally wants to throw Dizzy, which opens up midgames where Dizzy can either release it while blocking, or try to avoid the throw.
If Imperial Ray (632146 then release S) is performed while holding it, it will hit the opponent during the super flash, and the opponent cannot start blocking during the flash. However this will not combo into the Imperial Ray at long range and is costly in terms of meter, so it's mostly a trickshot to clinch a round against a low health opponent.
Properly tandeming with the homing attack is one of Dizzy's trickiest execution requirements, especially in combos like her Bubble Loop.

Necro throws a scythe. Like all projectiles, the later it hits, the more frame advantage you get, so scythe heavily rewards prediction, or spending an FRC to cover multiple spaces at once. It's guaranteed to come out on frame 27 and can be FRCed then, so it's harder to counterpoke after heavy moves than her other summons. It stays out even if Dizzy is hit, so sometimes it will trade. Both versions share a cooldown with Ice Spike (236H or 236D).
K-scythe goes up and then comes back down, so it's more frame advantage if blocked on the ground.

Works well in tandem with a 421[S], letting you charge up spike while covered by the falling scythe.
Can pin opponents in place to keep them from jumping when they are dealing with other projectiles.
Tends to force opponents to move forward under it to avoid blocking it, so Dizzy can FRC it and dash in to stop the approach with 5K/2K/2H.
FRC dash 5K > Knife or Fish > 5K > is a tight blockstring into fish pressure after the initial 5K because the scythe covers the gap.
Hits above Dizzy at a high and sharp angle, allowing it to cover the gap between the rising knife hitbox and S-scythe. However because of how early the scythe hits, this cannot be comboed from and leaves Dizzy in an awkward post-tech situation, so handle with care.
First hit will whiff vs many crouching opponents, but only the last hit matters for frame advantage, so in most cases this doesn't matter.

S-scythe goes down slightly the rises up, so it's more frame advantage if blocked in the air.

Strong predictive air control, and also covers the ground for a long time
Can be followed up with an air combo if it hits late enough.
Controls the ground until slightly after Dizzy has recovered, but generally not long enough for another summon without an FRC if the opponent dashes right as the scythe passes.
Even at its lowest point, it's low profiled by many moves.
Not enough blockstun to safely summon up close even with an FRC, but mixing between summoning and pressuring after it as well as backdashing into summons can make it difficult
Reasonably safe pressure ender against some characters, but like all her summons still punishable if done without cover and the opponent reacts predictively.

Dizzy utilizes Undine to create a bubble, while she is airborne, that floats in mid-air and slowly moves in varying trajectories depending on the attack button used.  Once summoned, the bubble will move in a specific trajectory until it is popped by an attack from Dizzy or it reaches its maximum allotted time limit.  If the opponent is hit by a popped bubble, they are launched into the air which creates an opportunity for a followup combo.
The j.214 series (Bubble) have various uses:  offense, defense, zoning, and okizeme.
Dizzy also has a specific combo option called the 'Bubble Loop', which utilizes a bubble as part of a combo to deal massive damage.
It is possible to tiger-knee (TK) this move (2147+P/K/S) which allows you to perform a quick bubble summon from the ground that is low-altitude and afterwards gives you access to aerial movement manuevers, such as airdash or jump cancel for either offensive/defensive followups.


j.214P
This bubble summon slowly moves forward in a horizontal trajectory until it is popped or reaches its maximum allotted time limit.  P Bubble can be used to control aerial space horizontally, which can often deter an opponent from approaching by air due to a possible anti-air attack from a popped bubble.


j.214K
This bubble summon slowly moves forward while descending at a 30° downward trajectory until it is popped or reaches its maximum allotted time limit.  K Bubble can be used like P Bubble to control aerial space and since it moves diagonally toward the ground it is effective as an air-to-ground option as it it able to reach and provide cover against standing/crouching opponents and especially on their wakeup as okizeme.


j.214S
This bubble summon slowly descends at at 75° downward trajectory until it is popped or reaches its maximum allotted time.  If S Bubble hits the ground, it bounces back up, which is noticable if you do a TK S Bubble.  Like K Bubble, S Bubble is effective as an air-to-ground option for cover, especially if it's used directly over an opponent.

Dizzy utilizes Undine to create an enhanced Bubble, while she is airborne, that homes in on the opponent and sticks to them until it is popped or reaches its maximum allotted time.
FB Bubble differs from the normal bubbles in a few ways:  it homes in quickly on an opponent rather than move in a set trajectory,  it has a larger hitbox when the bubble is popped, and the recovery time after input is longer than that of the normal bubbles.  You can use FB Bubble to determine an opponent's general location in you are airborne since it homes in on their position, which can give you some cover for your landing if you anticipate that the opponent will use an anti-air attack.  FB Bubble can be utilized with other summons for pressure.  An example would be to summon FB Bubble then do 421[S] and once the bubble is in range of the opponent, release ]S[ and dash in.

Dizzy summons a wave of fiery explosions that starts in front of her and moves across the screen.
A really versatile super. Can be used in neutral as a way to give yourself some space as both on hit and block this will push the opponent away to full screen. In combos it's one of Dizzy's only ways to secure an air knockdown and can even lead to some situational combos. It can even work as an abare due to the invulnerability starting from from frame 5 until the projectile appears meaning at worst it will trade into a knockdown and otherwise if they don't have a move active or are blocking before the superflash starts the projectile will hit them while they're still frozen.
To top all of this off there is no meter penalty for using this as supers don't give you any meter penalty.
It also has an FRC point during the superflash when Dizzy fully extends her arms to the side, that will let you act while the opponent is still briefly stuck in the superflash and it will also allow you to retain 9-8 frames of strike invulnerability meaning you can win situations that would normally lead to a trade.

Dizzy's reversal super.

When it connects Dizzy is still vulnerable for a few frames and can get hit by lingering hitboxes (mostly projectiles). Getting hit interrupts the attack.
Reaches approximately up to a 1/2 screen away.
Functions like a throw. Unblockable on the ground, but can be avoided by jumping. Will not connect if the opponent is in blockstun.
Despite this behaviour it still has a hitbox and will lose to strike or lower body invul moves (e.g. Slayer's 2H).
Can also function as an anti-air attack by using it just as the opponent is about to hit you from the air with a jump-in attack, their attack will whiff right through you and then they land in the activation range of the Overdrive.

Necro appears and fires 3 lasers at the opponent, which float them and spends 50% meter then he fires a large beam at the opponent that hits multiple times, spending the remaining 50% meter.
Though Gamma Ray looks impressive for an Overdrive, its use is rather limited due to its slow startup and 100% meter cost, it doesn't hit opponents that are close or above you, and Dizzy is quite vulnerable when using this Overdrive, which makes her prone to getting attacked and punished and waste Tension in the process. 
However if you do somehow manage this raw it will deal a lot of damage thanks to the 200% proration and additionally it's possible to FRC the second hit of the first set of lasers, which will give you a combo with 200% proration at the cost of 75% meter. 
Interestingly enough during the big beam part the super will shoot out small beams on top of main beam that acts just like the initial hit if they land raw, meaning they have both the float and 200% proration for whatever it's worth.

Requires 100% Tension to activate, but it'll only take 50% away from you at the point of activation. Then, after the 2nd hit connects, it'll drain the other 50%.

Incredibly impractical IK, with a ridiculously long startup and a abnormal input making it incredibly easy to see coming.

Unlike most characters, Dizzy has no IK mode.
You should buffer this input from a state where Dizzy cannot jump, such as her respect.
And the cherry on top: it also requires 100 tension.
If you do get a stun it's always much better to just do bubble combo.
This move is absolutely worthless in every situation. Never use it unless you want extremely impractical BM.
