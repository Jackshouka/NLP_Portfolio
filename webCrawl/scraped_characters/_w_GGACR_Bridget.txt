Overview
Bridget is known for her extensive air mobility and keepaway game, and she comes with some particularly strong high/low mixups and unblockable setups. 
Bridget can fly well over the top of the screen with her universal air movement options, as well as quickly get in and go for very quick overheads in pressure. her Yo-yo attacks and setup replace the functions of her H button, allowing Bridget to place slow moving, lingering hitboxes in places that some characters can have a very difficult time getting through. Attacking in tandem with Roger allows for Bridget to maintain pressure, and using Roger defensively lets Bridget get out of harm's way.
In exchange, Bridget suffers from low health and poor damage output, as well as generally not being able to score knockdowns out of air combos. This combined with her unusual movement options makes for a character that can be difficult to pick up but rewards those who put in the effort with an unconventional hit-and-run playstyle.
If you can master Bridget's movement, then players who love filling the screen with hitboxes and playing a hardcore keepaway game will love what she brings to the table.

 Bridget has great mobility and the game's best runaway, but also has very strong high/low and unblockable mixups.



Pros
Cons


Excellent Runaway/Keepaway Potential: Unparalleled air mobility and meter gain even on retreat lets Bridget control the pace from far away. Up to four "jumps" lets Bridget escape from nearly anywhere.
Strong Reversal Options: Starship is a grounded, FRC'able DP that can be difficult to punish, and Overdrives can come in clutch.
Roger Cover and Tandems: Roger provides space control, aids defense, and works for unblockable setups and pressure, and more.
Delayed Wakeup: Delayed get-up sets up yo-yo, and may mess up other characters oki.
Auto Throw OS: HS not having any normals attached to it allows for free throw attempts when Roger is active.
Great Anti Airs: 6P, 2S and 6S are great buttons to hit the opponent out of the sky with, all of them lead to combos depending on spacing.


Awfully low health: Low defense value, zero Guts, and being light weight can have Bridget being done the moment she's caught.
Limited Pressure: Lack of coverage tools and normals means Bridget is better suited to a hit-and-run style than fully pressing an advantage.
Poor Damage and Limited Confirms: Low damage and lacks means of scoring a knockdown out of air combos.
Meter Hungry: Good movement requires FD canceling Rolling Movement, limiting Tension income.
Low Margin of Error: Easily beaten buttons, less than airtight setups, and some very low health combine to make a character who can be notoriously difficult to manage.
Lack of Throw OS: Bridget's H Moves count as Specials, which have priority over normals. As a result, Bridget cannot perform Throw OSes unless Roger is active.

StartupThe time before an attack is active including the first active frame. For example, an attack with 10F startup means the attack will do nothing for 9 frames, then hit the opponent on the 10th frame. frames



ActiveThe active frames of an attack refers to the amount of time an attack can hit the opponent. Frames



InactiveFrames in the middle of multi-hit attacks which cannot hit the opponent, but are after the move has become active at least once. Frames



RecoveryThe recovery of an attack refers to the amount of time an attacker must wait before he may perform another action, even blocking. Frames



Special RecoveryThe recovery of an attack refers to the amount of time an attacker must wait before they may perform another action.Recovery frames which happen under abnormal conditions, such as after landing. Frames

Simple, horizontal jab that makes for a clutch anti-air. Usually falls out of favor to 2P for mashing.

Hits far above the ground, can be ducked under. Useful for "tick" throws.
Comes with a unique recovery animation where Bridget drops and retracts the yo-yo, which can lead to odd setups against her in very specific scenarios.

2-hit yo-yo pull trick mostly for combos. 

Can make for a good stopping point in pressure.
Has a large gap between hits which might make second hit whiff on FD, but it can be special canceled at any point after the first hit which mitigates this problem.
Combos to KSMH, but only on crouching hit or by canceling into KSMH before the second hit.

Bridget's most frequent ranged poke. Hits a great distance away, but is easily low profiled, IAD'd over, or upper body invul'd through.

Comes out pretty fast, but takes a while to fully extend afterwards.
Frequently gatling'd to 2D for short, sweet combos at moderate range.
Combos into 6S against big bodies, or can be used to gatling into a yoyo set.

Buttslam. Forward moving, difficult to contest, big stagger on CH making it perfect for frametraps. One of Bridget's best normals.

Has enough of a hop off the ground to go over low pokes/mash attempts.
Active for forever and a real pain for some characters to deal with.
Cancel into Starship for some tacked on damage on normal hit if that's what you want.
Will completely stuff a surprising number of normals thanks to it's rather disjointed hitbox. Anything Kickstart My Heart can beat, this can and more.

A rather average air throw, but one of the keys to Bridget.

Bridget's only method of air knockdown outside of certain moves on counter-hit.
As your throw button is the same as yo-yo set the punishment for whiffing this is much steeper than other characters if you do not either have Roger active in some way, or the yo-yo returning to you as a poor yo-yo set is timely to recover from and only rarely useful.
You can throw your opponent into an active Roger for a combo, or for a reset into another potential air throw.
Great way to catch tech outs after a combo by rolling to your yo-yo and using air throw to put them back in a corner .

Animation is the same as 6P. Best and only used when you're too lazy to block and have 50 meter. Because it's Bridget's 6P animation its one of the weaker dead angles in the game in terms of usefulness. However the good part about this move is if the yo-yo is out in a certain position, you can roll to the yo-yo and combo off this Dead Angle Attack.

Bridget recalls her yoyo. 

Pressing H will trigger the startup animation, while holding H will delay the yoyo's actual movement for up to ~2.5 seconds.
Pressing H again can cancel the callback, allowing you to move the yoyo closer without having to set it again.
Can be used to extend combos or pressure, or as a zoning tool. Provides plenty enough time to confirm into a combo on hit.
As this is considered a special move, you can cancel special cancelable normals into it allowing you to recover much faster from them than normal.
It's actually still possible for Bridget to use Rolling Movement while delaying a yoyo recall, but the input has to either be returned to neutral or TKed to avoid just Faultless Defending in place (in other words, the input becomes 2145K or 2147K).

Bridget uses her yo-yo's like roller blades and rides on them across the screen.

The speed of the move can be increased or decreased by holding forward or back respectively at any point during the move. Holding forward from frame 1 will clear the entire screen, not holding anything moves roughly two thirds, and by holding back you move less than the distance of a forward yo-yo set.
Can be canceled into Stop or Shoot at any point during the active frames even if it has already been blocked, giving it the potential to bait potential punishes with proper timing.

A follow up to KSMH. Bridget flings herself across the screen while swinging the yo-yos around. Stupidly high corner carry.

Can be special canceled into any air yo-yo set after the active frames end before Bridget hits the ground.
Extremely fast and needs to be FD blocked in the air, lending it some utility as an anti-air.
You can be air thrown if they block it so watch out.

A surprisingly incredible DP with a set of quirks setting it apart from others.

Grounded, up to 4 hits, and nonstandard hitstop can make this very difficult to bait or even punish.
Combos on hit or sets up a tech situation. Can knockdown if it CHs an extended hurtbox, eg. HOS's.
Has an FRC right at the tail end of it, guaranteeing it stays perfectly safe.
The hitbox of Starship does not extend to the floor, so some character's moves that keep them low to the floor will not be hit by it (Ky's Stun Dipper, Millia's roll, ABA's slide, etc).
How to punish: FD the first few hits so Bridget gets pushed out and then hit her. It is also vulnerable throws for up to 4 frames before it goes active.

The air version is just as versatile as the grounded version. Used to end air combos or bait reversals.

Can be used for knockdowns at low height, though this is more an edge case than anything.
Surprisingly safe-ish at only -5, especially if TK'd at range.
Has the same FRC as the grounded version.
Completely vulnerable to air throws.

Bridget summons Roger ready to punch people's faces. 

Roger will appear wherever the yo-yo is set and will make his way back to Bridget while punching.
Roger Rush will end once either he or Bridget is hit, he makes it back to Bridget, the move's duration expires, or if hits to a max of 3 times.
Staggers on hit usually long enough to run up and confirm into 5K, and is faster than Jagged Roger.

Bridget summons Roger equipped with a saw around its body.

Roger will appear wherever the yo-yo is set and make its way back to Bridget while the saw blade spins.
As opposed to Roger Rush, Jagged Roger returns to Bridget at a slower speed and stays out even when Bridget is hit after 22F.
Jagged Roger will end once 105 frames have passed, he makes it back to Bridget, or if it hits an opponent 3 times.
Can use the number of hits it has remaining to instead nullify an equivalent number of hits of a projectile. These act on the total number of hits remaining the same as if it was hitting an opponent.
Rather good at raising the opponent's guard bar if they don't FD.

The Yo-Yo becomes a sort of mechanism and homes in on the the opponent for a set distance.

Will stick with the opponent both on hit and block.
The mechanism acts just like a set yo-yo (i.e. any yo-yo move will occur right where the opponent is).
Roger Hug will end when 600F pass after sticking to opponent, Bridget is hit, or a yo-yo move other than Rolling Movement is done.

Bridget summons Roger who will then do a body slam and slide upon landing on the ground.

The direction which Roger drops depends on what direction you were facing when you set the yo-yo (i.e. if you set the yo-yo while facing the right side, Roger will drop towards the right side no matter what).
Depending on the height at which the yo-yo is placed, the move will have different properties.

Bridget rolls to her yoyo, wherever it is. Despite what you might at first think, this is the most important tool in Bridget's arsenal. Very strong mobility option. Canceling into it allows Bridget to extend pressure, confirm from situations she normally couldn't, and escape after a potentially unsafe poke.

Allows for very quick and low overheads since this leaves Bridget in an aerial state.
When immediately canceled into Faultless Defense, it provides a very fast "jump" that doesn't actually take up one of your aerial movement options when done in the air.
It can also be immediately canceled into a normal, making it extremely useful for extending combos.
Can be used as a pseudo-jump cancel on moves that aren't normally jump cancelable (such as f.S).
Exceptions are: 6K, 2D and j.D.

Roger will perform three punches in place. The first punch will stagger the opponent, the second knocks them airborne, and the third will wallstick them.

Opens the way for some strong combos on hit, and for mixup opportunities on block.
There's a window between the second and third punches where you can throw the opponent (or they can throw you), making the threat of a high/low/throw/no mixup mixup very real on block.
You can also use this window to crossup the opponent, by jumping over them right after the second punch.

This version of Jagged Roger will chase the opponent instead of returning to Bridget. Great option to throw out for 25% Tension. The opponent essentially has to respect it.

Active for so long that it can (and often does) punish people who burst it.
Will probably buy you a high/low mixup.

Extremely fast Anti-Air/Reversal that can be difficult to safejump. Will catch them if they're in the line of fire, and weren't blocking before the superflash.

The explosion is guaranteed to execute on input, meaning that trading this is very bad for the opponent.
Every hit must be FD'd while airborne, making this a dangerous consideration for opponents approaching from the air.
Bridget falls backwards and shrinks her hurtbox during recovery, making it awkward to punish.
Can work as a high damage combo ender, though this is usually inoptimal.

Long, obfuscating hitbox that tracks to Bridget, and is mainly used to cover her during mixups and approach. Very similar in function to Jagged Roger, but moves at speeds similar it's Force Break version.

Does a boatload of hits and tacks on a lot of damage compared to Bridget's overall kit. On block it does rather good chip and quickly raises the guard bar.
Stays active if Bridget is hit, discourages mashing or reversaling out.
Actually useful as a reversal, particularly with a close yo-yo, as it can cover Bridget's recovery.
Loses to throws, which will not only get Bridget hit, but will likely burn the rest of the move's active window.

The Delayed version moves more slowly, remaining more in place.

Useful if the opponent is far away on a knockdown and you want to keep them still while you approach.
Nonstandard hitstop allows for a bit of jank, but the fewer hits limits the time you have.
Has no invincibility compared to the normal version. Be sure not to mix them up!
