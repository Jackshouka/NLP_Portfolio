Overview
Chipp Zanuff is Guilty Gear's dedicated pixie character with insane mobility and mixup, but paper-thin defense. Chipp has access to a staggering amount of strong tools, which give him the advantage in just about any situation. Amazing buttons for pressure and neutral, teleporting, top-notch movement speed, and triple jumping are just the start. Chipp can cling to walls to mix the opponent up, halt his horizontal air momentum completely, become nearly invisible, the list goes on. Especially with resources on his side, Chipp can take control of almost any situation.
While he's without a doubt the fastest character in the game, Chipp's execution demands precision, as many of his basic conversion combos require microdashes, jump installs, and/or perfect Tiger Knees. This is in no way helped by the fact that chipp takes the most damage in the game by a longshot, so failing to meet his high execution requirements will spell his doom quickly. While Chipp has many tools to help his offense and even defense, there's no denying that losing a trade can spiral out of control quickly.
If you love playing high-speed pixies, then embrace your inner ninja and give Chipp a whirl.

Pros
Cons


Extremely Fast and Mobile: With the fastest run speed in the game, triple jumps, teleports, wall cling and faultless defense cancel, Chipp has an incredible amount of freedom in his ability to place himself anywhere on screen when he wants. Against many slower characters Chipp can often run circles around them and force them to take riskier approaches just to try and play catch up with him
Powerful Offense: Chipp has a variety of incredibly potent offensive options, including his c.SGuard:MidStartup:4Recovery:11Advantage:+2, a fast, versatile throw OS that offers frame advantage on block and a variety of gatlings, a throw invincible overheadGuard:High/AirStartup:19Recovery:3+3 after landingAdvantage:-1, a strike invincible, airborne command grabGuard:10 pixelsStartup:29Recovery:10 after landingAdvantage:, a plus on block projectile that traps the opponent in placeGuard:AllStartup:15Recovery:29Advantage:+5 as well as his Faultless Defense Cancel giving him unreactable left/right high/lows for OkizemeFrom Japanese "起き攻め". Attacking an opponent about to wake up after they were knocked down, usually with meaty attacks or mix-ups.. His wall clingGuard:Startup:Recovery:Advantage: also allows for further mixup opportunities against cornered opponents
Excellent Buttons: Chipp has a variety of great buttons such as 5KGuard:MidStartup:5Recovery:8Advantage:-3, c.SGuard:MidStartup:4Recovery:11Advantage:+2, 6PGuard:MidStartup:9Recovery:10Advantage:-1, 2SGuard:MidStartup:7Recovery:11Advantage:-1, j.KGuard:High/AirStartup:5Recovery:8Advantage:, j.HGuard:High/AirStartup:8Recovery:26Advantage: and j.DGuard:High/AirStartup:6Recovery:18+5 after landingAdvantage: that, when combined with his variety of movement options give Chipp an incredibly strong presence both on the ground and in the air
Whiff Punishing: Chipps teleport FRC, ground speed and variety of strong buttons allows him to pick up punishes on a variety of slower to whiff normals and specials that other characters may struggle to deal with, most notably projectiles like Justice's nukesGuard:AllStartup:7Recovery:Total 51Advantage:-13, and Sol's gunflameGuard:AllStartup:21Recovery:Total 50Advantage:-3
Diverse Toolbox: Chipps large, diverse toolset gives him a great amount of versatility in how he can choose to approach most any situation. Chipp can play both heavy rushdown, with a large focus on potent mixups and okizeme, or choose to play more defensively, choosing when to engage at his leisure very easily


Unforgiving Defense and Execution: While Chipp's execution isn't strictly uniquely difficult, his punishment for dropping things often results in him taking bigger damage punishes than most other characters would due to his uniquely high defense modifier.
No Options for Cover: Chipp's game is almost entirely physical and can quickly turn against his favor if read or properly countered, often requiring Chipp to mix up his options on offense, defense and neutral in order to prevent the opponent from getting a good read on what he tries to do
Difficulty in combo optimization: Chipp often relies on character specific routing or situational confirms using close hit, crouching hit or dash momentum in order to reliably confirm hits into both decent damage and a knockdown
Meter Hungry: Chipp has a variety of strong ways to spend meter for extending combos, ending them, pushing mixups, and augmenting his punish game. However, due to the meter penalty induced by FRCs, Force Breaks and FDCs, Chipp can often find himself short for meter, severely limiting both his damage and neutral

Amazing normal, one of Chipp's most used buttons and all around incredibly useful, especially when combined with his grounded movement. Fast, self cancels, has a great hitbox, and has an extensive gatling tree

Self gatlings for confirms and pressure. Also jump cancels allowing Chipp to Jump InstallAn advanced technique that lets you access air mobility options, usually double jumping, after doing a move that is supposed to prevent you from doing them. Usually performed by cancelling a grounded normal into a jump, but then before leaving the ground, doing another grounded attack. teleports for both combos and oki setups
The disjointed hitbox allows it to beat out many pokes of similar or slower speed
Vulnerable to Low ProfileWhen a character's hurtbox is entirely beneath an opponent's attack. This can be caused by crouching, certain moves, and being short., but often results in both moves whiffing due to the lack of lower hurtbox on 5K
Has a late gatling into 5P/2P/2K from frame 6 that extends into its recovery.

Hits up to three times on the way down and can be cancelled on landing immediately for a conversion.
Will cause Chipp to plummet down on use, cutting his momentum.
Carries this property when FDC'd to make crossups ambiguous.

Wall Cling followed by an angled dive, either about 15° or 45° (if you hold 6 or 3 after leaving the wall). Chipp can act out of it immediately and retains all of his remaining aerial movement options. Leads to very powerful mixups.

Performed by, while being right next to the wall, hitting towards the wall, then away from it. Can be done when Chipp has an air jump or airdash available.
Cancelling into low airdash j.H or land 2D is unreactable, can be further layered if the opponent is slightly out of the corner.
All of Chipp's air normals, and 41236K~D can be cancelled into this, even during startup and recovery
Teleport can lead into Wall Cling as well, but must be jump installed beforehand.
Puts Chipp in counter hit state during use, proceed with caution when done outside of okizeme.
Note:
You can take yourself out of CH state by: tapping FD/SB, FDC/SBC j.2K, or using F.Shuriken. Each of these options technically come with slight faults given you're either: sacrificing opportunities to react accordingly if you intend to throw out something from wallcling and have no method for buffering said option as soon as wall cling start up is over while also potentially staggering tension gain (applies to FD/SB/F.Shuriken) or exchanging a multipurpose tool that can almost entirely flesh out some of the characters faults for a slightly more defense oriented air stall tool (F.Shuriken).

Slightly low profile transport attack that can go through the opponent. Combos out of 5H/6H when close, or on crouching hit. Can lead to big damage.

Decent damage. Very unsafe, but properly spaced some characters cannot punish this reliably.
Completely negates Chipp's momentum when RC'd, can convert out of this.
Situational mixup tool when used in conjunction with Alpha Plus (FRC).
Can score a knockdown from farther away when combo conditions are met.
Spending 25 meter to cancel to FB Alpha Blade will score more damage and lead to knockdown.
Is airborne from frame 1, making it invulnerable to throws and allowing it to go over moves like Potemkin's Slide HeadGuard:Low, UnblockableStartup:23Recovery:25Advantage:-11.

Air version is generally superior to the ground version as it recovers quicker and has more hitstun, leading to combos and Chipp's Alpha Blade loops.

Recovers quickly enough that it will convert when done as close to the ground as possible .
This is commonly referred to as Instant Air Alpha/IAA.
Can be FRC'd during the first three active frames for loops, or other conversions.
Will launch Chipp upward if done during the ascent of Chipp's jump.
Loses the ability to cross through the opponent, which can lead to further mixups.

5F Reversal which is active all the way up. Gets them off of you when you need the breather.

If RC'd on the first hitbox, Chipp will remain grounded and be able to dash afterwards for a conversion.
Fully untechable on Counter Hit.
Auto Jump Installed so you can safely retreat if you spend the meter while airborne.
Can be FRC'd when the active box ends, can convert on counter hit.
Has a fairly thin hitbox, take care not to get baited.
Done with dashing momentum, this can be very difficult to punish.

In the air. Wins the air-to-air war when used properly.

Even faster at frame 3, but less active, no throw invul, and with no FRC point.
Still fully untechable on Counter Hit, can RC to adjust for more sudden confirm opportunities.
Its the ver. you see used by most at mid-high lv players as it carries more horizontal than the grounded ver. meaning it allows for meterless conversions while also providing more safety on block/whiff in some cases.
Solid as a rising aa as well despite the drop in invuln frames (more so when dashing than standing because of the added confirmabilty).
Mostly used at the end of air combos when you need the damage, but leaves Chipp in a less favorable position.

Powerful tool which overall allows Chipp to move with unpredictability, score punishes from far away, escape from poor situations, or go for the mixup. Use with practicality or abandon, sometimes Chipp can get away with it.

Each version has a small window of strike invincibility as Chipp goes invisible.

P moves Chipp forwards slightly, about a 1/5th to 1/4th of the screen. The quickest and shortest duration ground teleport.

Useful for going through slow projectiles with long recovery on prediction.
The shorter duration can let Chipp nab initiative or a grab very quickly.
Will pass through the opponent when done at a range a bit shorter than 2P. Can burn frames on oki for trickier setups.

K moves significantly forward, about 2/3rds of the screen.

Calls out slow, punishable moves from afar.
Slightly more recovery than P Teleport, punishes will be a bit stricter.
Will pass through the opponent at ranges a bit farther than 6H.

S is a retreating teleport with the most recovery.

Gets Chipp outta dodge, must be called out with a dashing or forward moving attack.
Puts Chipp airborne after teleporting, which might not be favorable.
Is the only TP that's auto jump installed, meaning you can also AJI 22H/D on your landing with decent enough timing.
Can be FRC'd after changing location with air options intact, allowing Chipp to immediately airdash or double jump for extended pressure or resets.

H is a forward aerial homing teleport that puts Chipp above and in front of the opponent. Leads to FRC shenanigans.

Mainly used after 2H for air combo conversions.
Must be jump installed for further air actions besides using an air normal/special.
Best if jump installed normally from a gatling string beforehand.
Can be jump installed by itself by doing 228+H. Will only install options available from super jump; no double jump or wall dive, only airdash.
FRC allows Chipp to attack from the air almost immediately, setting up powerful resets into vortexes.
Mix with other teleports against opponents who attempt to call out H Teleport with airthrows.
Will maintain dashing momentum.

D teleports above and behind opponent, but otherwise nearly identical to H Teleport.

Also used in 2H conversions if a sideswap is desired.
Jump installs the same way as H Teleport.
Will put Chipp at the wall if done when the opponent is cornered, allowing for immediate Wall Clings if jump installed.
FRC point and other notes from H Teleport apply here.

Slow version is a Participation Prize. Use this awful version solely for the sake of getting to the good version.

Extremely slow "projectile" which doesn't act as a projectile, and exists just to keep the good version from being one of the best moves in the game.
Completely stalls Chipp on use, holding him in the air and preventing further action until he lands.
Despite this weakness, some characters lack the means to reliably punish Chipp if used out of a triple/high jump.
Do not Tiger Knee this. Chipp will fly up in the direction he was traveling but will be unable to act for the entire arc.
Be smart about when to use this, as the benefit of having fast shuriken is very enticing.

Fast version is a Trophy Wife. One of the most versatile moves in Chipp's toolkit.

Extremely fast tool which can change the followups of many of Chipp's normals on hit/block.
Recovers almost immediately, allowing Chipp to extend things with a airdashes or other jumps.
Can cover Chipp's approaches or retreats.
Still only does 1 damage but is otherwise excellent at everything else it does.
Both versions will disappear if Chipp is hit.
Neither version is actually considered a projectile, and are unaffected by Potemkins FlickGuard:AllStartup:21Recovery:12Advantage:+2. Can be very good for stalling vs him

Beta Blade on PCP. Invincible for nearly half a second. Monster of a reversal.

Invincible until 26F, 4 hits, launches them extremely high and far away.
Tacks on higher damage at the end of air combos.
Combos non-OTG after throw, but is frame perfect.
CH state during a bulk of the active frames and a few frames of recovery, making it a bit riskier than regular Beta Blade.
No FRC or auto jump install, but otherwise still a stronger reversal.
There is a wide enough gap between the 1st and 2nd hit that a handful of characters can reversal/low profile through (or IB > AT), few get much out of doing this in most cases but its still something decent to keep in mind when dealing with this yourself or throwing it out against others.

Stronger version of Gamma Blade that freezes the opponent in place for roughly one and a half seconds on hit. Allows for some real jank.

Functionally similar to regular Gamma Blade, but it lasts about twice as long and travels approx. 33%~ farther (almost full screen).
The opponent's state will change based on what hits them during the freeze period, and will carry over.
E.G. 6H will cause the opponent to floor bounce once the freeze period ends.
Will not remove OTG, meaning the opponent can still be in an OTG state once the freeze period ends.

Extremely high damage Overdrive, but incredibly slow and requires specific conditions to combo into. Can be used for nonsense with enough meter to FRC, or when the opponent is very low on health.

260 base damage, but will only combo out of aerial 6H, and only if close enough, and not against Sols.
A full 33F of invincibility makes this a fullscreen callout/punish against very high recovery moves.
Despite this, Beta Blade still makes for a better reversal.
Does not have to be blocked in alternating directions unless FD'd, so will catch players unaware if they are low on health and must FD to survive.
Can be FRC'd before/on the 1st or 3rd hits. This will make it safe or allow for immediate land > throw/mixup setups.
Will not trigger the last hit on some standing or crouching characters on block as they are too short for the 5th hit to make contact.
Will likely get you IK'd by over half the cast if they trigger the 6th hit on block, as it allows the opponent ample time to back up, go into IK mode, and trigger it as the last hit whiffs.

Tacks on at the end of ranged hits for easy damage and knockdown. Even less safe than Zansei Rouga.

Good for ending a round as the high number of hits is useful for offsetting damage reduction due to guts and scaling.
Only has invincibility after the super flash, preventing this from use as a reversal.
Fast enough to combo non-OTG after a throw (except against Faust and Jam on whom it will not work).
Will also fully combo after a Leaf Throw against Potemkin, Jam, Johnny, Testament, Zappa, Kliff, and Justice.
90% of the cast can IK this on block. FD'ing will push Chipp out far enough that the remaining hits will continue to whiff.
