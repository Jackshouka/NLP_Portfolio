Eddie has unblockables, pressure for days, flight, and plenty of dual attacking options to deal with opponent's defensive options. Letting Eddie get the initiative is suicide and all of the pressure is placed on the opponent once Eddie gets in and runs his game. On the flip side, Eddie is horribly weak defensively. When his shadow gauge is emptied, he must often run away, or contend with his overall subpar normals. He has the worst guts in the game with a bad defense modifier, a poor backdash, slower buttons, and no meterless reversal. His Dead Angle is barely passable and his reversal super is downright awful. Worse yet, Eddie's shadow can actually be killed if it's successfully poked out, meaning one wrong move is all it takes for Eddie to immediately lose all of his offensive threat. Eddie is a character who wants to get in and stay on the absolute offensive, giving the opponent zero chance to breathe. If you can master his unconventional fighting style, then you'll learn to love the overwhelming offensive options Eddie brings to the table       Damage Received Mod x1.06 Guts Rating 0/5 Gravity Mod x1 Stun Resistance 60 Prejump 3F Backdash 16F (1~7F Strike Invuln) Wakeup Timing 53F (Face Up)/ 49F (Face Down) Number of Jumps: 2 Number of Air Dashes: 1 Unique Movement Options FlightBreak the LawTraversing Fastest Attack 2P (5F) Reversals 632146H (16F)        Eddie is an archetype-defining puppet character with a myriad of overwhelming offensive pressure. Pros Cons   Strong Block Strings and Mixups: When working together with shadow, Eddie has access to incredible offensive pressure that can can be looped and made reversal safe. Low Commitment Zoning with Shadow: Eddie and his shadow can cover a variety of spacings and timings without putting themselves at much risk. High Reward: Eddie often gets good damage and strong okizeme options after a successful close-range hit. With meter, Eddie can set up practical unblockables and demolish health bars. Great Movement Toolbox: Eddie has several unique tools such as Flight, a unique controllable airdash, Break The Law and swapping places with shadow. One can mix up your approaches a lot and cover oneself with the shadow to prevent anti-airs. Screen Control with Shadow: With shadow out, Eddie has access to long range lows, strong anti-airs, good mid-range pokes and high reward when up close. Eddie doesn't really have a position he doesn't want to be in with shadow. Poor Defensive Options: Eddie has below average health and defense stats, few reversal options (including a bad Dead Angle), poor abare, and poor punish options. Getting crossed-up by the opponent can also interfere with his shadow options. To compound the issue, getting hit or blocking unsummons the shadow. Flight Drawbacks It is more difficult to move out of the range of air throws than with a normal double jump and Eddie cannot block during flight. Needs Shadow: Without Shadow ready, Eddie is often described as "half of a character". The shadow is an essential part of his gameplan, so managing the Shadow Gauge is an important skill to learn. Finnicky Lockdown: Shadow's limited movement speed can make it difficult to stop people from moving around. Unique Mechanics Shadow Gauge  Shadow Gauge The shadow, Little Eddie, can only be used while the gauge is not depleted. Every shadow attack will drain some of this bar. Controlling the Shadow  Controlling the Shadow Little Eddie attacks only when corresponding buttons are released not pressed. With proper meter management and execution, Eddie is capable of attacking alongside the shadow for devastating simultaneous attacks. This gives Eddie his extensive offensive pressure game and allows tandem attacks to prevent escapes and multiple mixup opportunities per blockstring, with varying levels of punishment depending on how much meter is left. He can also spend 25% meter to extend his gauge further, and exclusive to +R, he can also perform a "Vice" summon, which gives the shadow a moveset closer to Eddie's XX and #R iteration, which is generally much stronger in the corner. If it is emptied however, Eddie loses access to this shadow for several seconds, and cannot summon, leaving him susceptible to being stuck in a very bad defensive position. Proper control of this gauge is key. Starter Guide   Starter Guide Need help getting started? Go to this page for information targeted at new players.

Eddie's main mechanic and defining trait. Your goal when solo is to get him out safely ASAP. Normal summon (236H) is generally preferred in neutral and midscreen. Summoning with 236P/236K/236S will perform the corresponding Shadow move on the first possible frame. Vice summon (214H) is an alternate moveset for the shadow taking moves from older Guilty Gear titles. The moves are generally better than the normal summon when the opponent is cornered. Mixing up between drills and summon is your best option when making the opponent block solo. Drills bait escape options or abare and will knock down if successful and allow a free summon. Summoning will take advantage of when they are scared to press any buttons but normally will lose if they press buttons. Eddie's Shadow will take a hit if they are both in the same hitbox. You can take advantage of this to create reversal safe pressure, but it is generally advisable to keep the Shadow alive. If the shadow gauge runs out naturally, or the Shadow gets Hit, you will not be able to use it until the gauge fills again. (236D will not help you if Shadow is dead). Getting hit or blocking will automatically unsummon the Shadow. Use 236P/K/S/H when Shadow is already out to unsummon. If you do this the Shadow Gauge will recharge faster than if dead, and you will be allowed to use without it needing to be completely full. Doing this will cancel any Shadow special being performed without recovery for the Shadow. Shadow is controllable from frame 12 if using 236H summon. Otherwise performs Traversing/Small/Anti-Air Attack as soon as possible.

Mawaru will also juggle the opponent If you launched them previously (probably with 22S/22H), opening up nasty unblockable set-ups, which are discussed in the combo section.

Not very useful. Can be used if the opponent likes to cross up to get the Shadow back in the right place. Also cancels any Shadow special which can be used for gimmicks. It's invulnerable on frame 1, meaning that some attacks can be avoided and then punished without having to block and consequently lose shadow. For example, you can try to read a Dead Angle Attack during shadow pressure and punish the recovery frames. Can be used as a very gimmicky pressure tool alongside ]P[, so that you can teleport from fullscreen and then throw them, or get shadow behind and then cross them up. This is very unsafe however and should only be done as a very infrequent option just to keep them guessing.

Puts them in blockstun for a very long time, allowing for mix-ups best suited in the corner. While rarer, Vice Mawaru for midscreen pressure can be the right call against characters with strong ways to punish the gaps in Normal Mawaru ( Slayer,  Zappa  Potemkin, to name a few)  FRC Window Proration Guard Bar+ Guard Bar- Level   N/A  6×4 8×4 3   Costs 301 points (※2)  Anti-Air Attack Vice ]S[ with Vice Shadow   Tabber requires Javascript to function.

Since it goes straight up, it's less useful as a pure Anti Air, but it makes up for it by being easier to combo from than Normal Summon's Nobiru in the corner (although you still lose on damage) and covering a blind spot for Eddie, which is right above him.

Can also be used to maneuver the shadow, allowing it to potentially avoid pokes and projectiles.

A lot of his slow moves can cancel into Drunkard Shade, allowing him to continue combos and make them somewhat safe in the case of 6H. Throw invincible at the start. Great against characters with a command grab like Potemkin, Slayer, Sol or another Eddie. Since it's Throw invincible, and it wallbounces on CH, Drunkard is also your best option against throw happy opponents on their wake up. FRC point at 9~10F when you REALLY messed up after a 6H to make it more safe.

Damage Guard Startup Active Recovery On-Block Invuln   71 70 pixels 6 1 18       Total: 24 If the insane high-low mixup he has wasn't enough, he also has access to a fairly fast Command Grab. Use the aforementioned mix-up as well as tick throws with this in Tandem and your pressure will reach ridiculous levels. On its own, it's a pretty decent command grab, although somewhat slow. With shadow out, though, inputting this move normally will naturally make the Shadow do a Nobiru, guaranteeing your safety or giving you a CH Punish if they were mashing. The shadow can move freely while Zato is doing Damned Fang. If normal shadow is out, you can use Damned Fang, move the Shadow so it's placed away from the opponent, do -H-, and then make them land in the puddle or set up and unblockable with Vice's -H-. Damned Fang has a very generous FRC during the 7~9F after the opponent gets stabbed. This restores air options, allowing you to get an Air Combo going with an Air Dash to close a round. Midscreen you can use this to get much more advantage while still being near. Use 66[2] to space yourself out of throw range. If Shadow is not already summoned Damned Fang gives you enough frame advantage to summon and still get a meaty drill in the corner.

Still knocks down but gives you more frame advantage in exchange for much less damage. Leaves Eddie right next to the opponent after recovery. It is sometimes useful on neutral depending on the character. Notably, you can punish characters like  Faust the moment they enter the stance if you tiger knee it, or it can be done in reaction to a  Potemkin doing Heavenly Potemkin BusterGuard:UnblockableStartup:12+1Recovery:10Advantage:.
