He can get around most of the cast while airborne, has large range on his pokes, and has one of the best projectiles in the game, coin, which is plus on block and covers two very oppressive arcs. Mist Finer Cancels and dash/stance Jackhound give him some difficult and unorthodox, but cool means of cancels and conversions. If you can get a handle on Johnny's movelist, then you'll gain access to some incredible offensive capabilities. The operative word there is "if", though. Johnny is one of the more difficult characters to play in +R thanks to high execution and few quirks. Many of Johnny's optimal combos are highly character specific and require a good amount of height management to perform, meaning players may need to grind more than usual on finding combos that work for him. His ground mobility is limited without wavedashing or proper transport use, and some of his hitboxes are very awkward, meaning Johnny must often play patiently and considerately to win neutral. If you're willing to commit to getting used to these issues and love the idea of playing one of the coolest characters in the game, Johnny might be your man.

Pros Cons   Long Horizontal Range: Johnny has strong options for controlling horizontal space such as f.S, Mist Finer, and more. Good Anti-airs: 6P, 5P, and Mist Finer are potent anti-airs when used at the appropriate spacings. High Damage Potential: Can find multiple conversions into complicated-yet-extensively rewarding combos. Leads to making his strike/throw game being far more threatening. Very Strong Air Options: Divine Blade, Ensenga, Unchou's Iai, Killer Joker, and Johnny's air normals are all excellent tools for neutral and combos. Unblockables: Using level 2 Mist Finer, Enkasu, and Bacchus Sigh, Johnny can set up unblockables during OkizemeFrom Japanese "起き攻め". Attacking an opponent about to wake up after they were knocked down, usually with meaty attacks or mix-ups.. Strike/Throw Mixups: Johnny's step dash and up-coin help him create throw mixups that are hard to avoid, and lead to decent reward. Good Mobility: Despite not having a run, Johnny's step dash can be applied in creative ways to bolster his offense. Furthermore, his jump and superjump pair well with his strong air attacks to make it difficult for opponents to contest his air options from the ground. Susceptible to Low Profile: Some of Johnny's best pokes, such as f.S, can be low profiled due to their thin hitboxes. Damage Requires Resources: Johnny's high damage combos will often require coins, meter, or both. Committal Pokes: In spite of his threatening tools, mishandling of any of them leads to much of his own gaps being easily exposed. Stability: Johnny can have difficulty securing hard knockdowns without level 2 Mist Finer, and even then will sometimes have to choose between knockdown and damage. This problem is exacerbated by the difficulty of performing his good combo routes which can lead to the character having stability issues in competitive play. Struggles with Zoning: Johnny's movement options, although great for offense, are flawed in terms of avoiding zoning tools. Furthermore, Johnny can struggle when the opponent has better normals than him in a given situation.

By special canceling a normal into Mist Finer StanceGuard:Startup:Recovery:See notesAdvantage:, and then exiting Mist Finer Stance by pressing the H button, Johnny can get the effects of a special cancel without committing fully to a special move. This, in practice, allows the player to modify Johnny's frame advantage on block and on hit substantially. Some moves that are substantially minus on block can become plus on block through Mist Canceling.For example: 5HGuard:MidStartup:11Recovery:33Advantage:-16/+7/+10/+12 is normally -16 on block. When Mist Canceled it becomes +7 — turning the move from punishable to advantaged.The frame advantage from Mist Canceling becomes better as the level for Mist Finer increases. This is because the startup for Mist Finer Stance becomes faster as the level of the move goes up. Starter Guide   Starter Guide Need help getting started?

Hits sooner than a normal-cancelled dash, making it good for pressure and chasing opponents. It goes over most mid pokes, but is easily called out by low-hitting pokes. It also has some upper body invincibility in the middle of its startup, but is still more of a ground-to-air poke than an anti-air. FRC window on frames 12~13f makes it useful for tick throws.

First hit hits around the feet, where 5H doesn't. Also has a lot of active frames. Second hit is like a 5H. Solid meaty at max range, as it will clash with Sol's Volcanic Viper, but somewhat gimmicky as the range needed to induce a clash is a giveaway to what you are trying to do. If you have ample time after your corner Bacchus Sigh setups, this is one move you can use to make sure your opponent stays in place on wakeup.

Do a move that is special cancelable. 2. Special cancel in to a Mist Finer. 3. Hold button to stay in Mist Stance. 4. While holding button, press H to Stance Cancel (Note: Holding the button when mist cancelling is not mandatory as of Accent Core. If H is inputted during the window of mist stance startup, it will cancel at the first possible frame. However, if H is not inputted during that window, the actual Mist Finer will come out. While this technique makes it easier to perform the fastest possible mist cancelling, it is much easier to make a mistake. Thus, it is recommended to hold the button unless you have a good grasp of the timing and have good execution.)

On hit, increases Mist Level by one. On block, it offers good frame advantage and a way to continue pressure, but be wary of the arc the coin travels in. If used thoughtlessly, some characters may be able to hit you and/or avoid the move with moves that have low-profile properties(e.g. Ky's Stun Dipper, Sol's 2D or Grand Viper). The coin spawns at Johnny's finger tips, so using it too close will cause Johnny's hand to go through the opponent and spawn the coin behind them. Has its uses as a zoning tool, with the 214H version as a recent addition to +R being a good way to call-out aerial approaches or to prevent liberal occurrences of them. For the most part, in combos, the coins often serve more to extend them into repeated Level 2 Mist Finers in the hands of dexterous players, given the benefits of the said Level 2 versions as combo tools on their own. Even then, trying to throw coins randomly may exhaust your options, but the best reward is always finding a way to stick them into a combo of any sort.

Opponent cannot block Mist Finer attacks for as long as Bacchus Sigh is attached. Projectile moves rather slowly, but has some slight tracking. Even then, trying to rely on this to land on your foe in the open isn't going to do any wonders. Will attach to downed opponents, thus it's a prime oki tool should Johnny score a valuable knockdown with time to act.

Not a projectile. Connecting with only the first hit gives an advantageous knockdown. This is called an Enkasu. Can be tiger-kneed for a quick overhead. Leads to damaging combos when RCd. First hit scores knockdown at most heights against the entire cast. Second hit causes a Blowback effect, which can score knockdown at low heights. Note that when both hits connect, the knockdown of the first hit is canceled out by the Blowback of the second.

Despite its speed, it can be easily mishandled into exposing Johnny for a punish; trying to use it as a form of cross-ups is rather ill-advised.

Consumes 25% Tension. On hit, increases Mist Level by one. Despite the input technically being different, bear in mind that it's actually the same motion twice because you're now facing the opposite direction.

On hit it resets both Johnny and the opponent to a static vertical position (although horizontal distance is the same as when it connects) allowing you to stabilize air combos to either continue the combo, end in a level up, or further extend your damage. On whiff or block, Johnny will land and pause a moment to sheathe his katana, leaving him in a prolonged state of vulnerability. Be sure of yourself when you throw this out.
