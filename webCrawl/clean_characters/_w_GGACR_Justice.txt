Justice is a character of very polarizing matchups, her optimal range varying depending on the opponent. She aims to keep out close range opponents with a field of projectiles and her huge range normals, but will opt to stay in close quarters against other characters that can murder her from far away. With at least 25% meter, she can increase her damage substantially, use Saperia Trance to approach quickly, or deploy multiple nukes quickly. Yet, when opponents get to their optimal space, Justice can have an extremely hard time due to her horrid mobility, lacking any damaging reversals outside of meter, and with her projectile game being slow and one-dimensional. Her combos are fairly easy and can deal significant damage even without meter, but in her weaker matchups, Justice will generally have to work around the opponent's strengths and play off of whatever she can do in given situations.

Pros Cons   Nuclear War Crimes: NukesGuard:AllStartup:7Recovery:Total 51Advantage:-13 are nigh indestructible projectiles which Justice can pollute the screen with to shut down entire lanes of movement. They can make or break matchups, and filter people who haven't done their homework. Giant Reach: Many of Justice's attacks—such as f.S, 2S, 6H, and Michael SwordGuard:MidStartup:11Recovery:15Advantage:-5—cover large zones of screen space. Moves like these, paired with Nukes, enable Justice to dominate neutral. Strong Mixer: Justice is able to apply threatening mixups using her fast, overhead 6P and her long throw range. She can keep the opponent locked down for extended periods by spending meter on Nuke FRC—raising the opponent's guard bar, and consequently her reward. High Damage and Meter Gain: Justice gains a lot of tension and has great base damage. As a result, she can usually chunk an opponent's life bar without the need for an optimal combo starter. Useful Defensive Toolbox: She has one of the best defensive backdashes in the game, a fullscreen reversal super with an FRC, a pseudo-DP, a counter, and great throw and airthrow range. Can Take a Beating: Great guts, an average defense modifier, and low guard balance make Justice hard to kill. Limited Movement: Having no forward ground or airdashes, Justice must often play extremely patiently or take a risk with meter if she needs to get in. Big Target: Has a massive hurtbox, making her susceptible to fuzzies, extended combos, and makes playing around traps and projectiles a pain in certain matchups. She also has a number of unfortunate extended hurtboxes, which can be counter-poked and punished. Incredibly Polarizing Matchups: Both a pro and a con, but characters tend to either be completely shut down by Justice's projectile game, or can consistently bypass it and make Justice's life hell.

StartupThe time before an attack is active including the first active frame. For example, an attack with 10F startup means the attack will do nothing for 9 frames, then hit the opponent on the 10th frame. frames    ActiveThe active frames of an attack refers to the amount of time an attack can hit the opponent. Frames    InactiveFrames in the middle of multi-hit attacks which cannot hit the opponent, but are after the move has become active at least once.

Particularly effective against opponents trying to dash underneath nukes towards Justice. Leaves her very vulnerable on whiff, so needs some consideration before using. Its other main use is in combos, including crouch confirms to combo into H Michael Sword. Gatling options after it are very limited, but it's a solid point for Nuke FRC pressure rebuys.

Upper body invincible, jump cancellable, and gatlings from and to nearly everything. Also forces crouching on hit, thus combos into 5H > HMS for a wallbounce into a closer knockdown or alternatively RC > 6H > air combo, you'll be doing that a lot.

Prime punish starter. In neutral this is Justice's farthest reaching meterless attack and can be used to try and catch the opponent, but is terrible on whiff. Staggers on counterhit and shines in blockstrings due to its second hit vacuum effect and heavy guard bar build. Creates fearsome pressure with nuke FRC mixups and frametraps with both Michael Swords. Outside of a raw hit, 6H can be used with a variety of starters. However a major concern is range. Towards the end of its range the second hit will whiff, so it's better to go into SMS, Michael Blade, or on counterhit, HMS.

Good poke, combos to 5H/2D or 2H if close enough, or to 6H on counter hit. Scales better than f.S, better for combo filler. Can be used for relaunches, due to being jump cancellable, a tad hard to get the right height. Pushes out fairly far on hit, keep this in mind.

Large disjointed hitbox makes it a good predictive counterpoke against certain moves and a pretty good anti-air. Not jump or special cancellable, but has enough untech to link into c.S or her faster air buttons for a full combo. Alternatively goes into H/D Nuke for knockdown. Note: Second hit of 2H will whiff on Faust in most situations, with 2H(1) into c.S being a 1F link from ground hit and j.P/5K having tight timing from spaced hit. Consider the risks before using 2H in this matchup.

Combos from j.P and j.K for gaining height in air strings. Generally used in conjunction with j.D for damage, and j.H for knockdown. The first hit has higher than average hitstun in order to combo into air HMS, allowing for rejumps and a closer knockdown. Can be jump cancelled at any point after the first hit has made contact. Hits well above Justice from farther away near the end of the active window for air-to-air.

Great for spaced air-to-ground approaches, and for knockdowns out of air combos and after air HMS.

Floor slides on counter hit for big conversions with Michael Blade, Saperia, or 6H. 41236H is slower and wallbounces, bringing them back to you from nearly anywhere. Combos from 6H ground hit, crouching hit 5H, or counter hits, opening up her biggest damage routes. Requires meter to convert from hits other than 6H, but even just getting close knockdown is good in some matchups.

One of Justice's strongest options. Particularly menacing when TK'd. Blows back in the same fashion as the ground SMS. Useful against close range characters. Easy aerial combo ender, blows the opponent fullscreen, allowing for Nuke setups. You should whiff an air button after it. Can be FRC'd on the first hit, which causes the opponent to fall straight down. Converts when grounded with c.S, 6H, 2H, etc. Using either air MS prevents use of another until Justice lands and jumps again. Justice can score a single hit air SMS that knocks down more closely, allowing for her optimal okizeme. The opponent must be slightly below and behind Justice, and is usually done after an air combo into j.S(1) > j.H. These combos can be found here. j.41236H is used in combo ending and rejumps. Allows Justice to score closer ranged knockdowns out of the air. Does more damage than air SMS. Wallbounces, allowing Justice to follow with a j.H for knockdown. Slow enough that it only combos out of the first hit of j.S. j.D > Saperia Trance converts if they're high enough, for more damage and close oki. Preferable combo ender against characters that outzone Justice or can easily get around nukes.

Not fully invul, but Justice's hurtbox shrinks significantly on the first frame. Similar to 6H, this move has a vacuum effect on block and launches on hit. The former is very undesirable given its lengthy recovery, but the FRC on S.B.T. not only makes it safe but provides advantage, or in the case of a hit, a combo opportunity. Since it is throw invulnerable throughout startup and active frames, S.B.T. can also be used up close on an opponent's wakeup to try and bait a throw. Best performed along with the FRC to allow continuation of pressure.

All around vital tool. Used for keepaway, oki, knockdown, damage, etc. What defines a matchup. Manual detonation is important as it prevents projectile from being easily bypassed. Depending on character and which nuke was launched, low profiling, (super)jump airdash, and poking with extended hurtbox can all be valid ways to avoid undetonated nuke and must be played around. Even then some hurtboxes can just avoid it entirely (e.g. Millia running under K nuke). Will pass through almost every other projectile unhindered, save for edge cases as Venom's Lightning Ball or Ky's Sacred Edge. Can be FRC'd as soon as they come out for safety, another nuke, or a mixup. Nukes will continue to travel as long as the corresponding button is held down, essentially disabling it until release. It is possible to release and repress it during hitstop without detonating the nuke. Every nuke will disappear if Justice is hit. To see how N.B interact with specific projectiles, see Nuclear Blast Interactions.

Will cross the entire screen and smack the opponent off of the opposite wall, knocking down or allowing for a relaunch. Will go through every projectile in the game, including Dizzy's FB Spike and a Gamma Ray in Justice mirrors. Has short, nonstandard hitstop, making it more difficult for opponents to react to. Justice can pass through the opponent on Saperia Trance's recovery, so you can do silly tricks like whiff and throw, crossup whiff into poke. Good movement option for 25 meter. Converts to 2H afterwards, it's a link and depends on screen positioning, because of how iffy Saperia can be. Always converts on CH. Counterhit recovery. If you meet the person who slashbacks Saperia, send me the clip of you dying. Air version is better for combos and crossup setups than grounded Saperia Trance. Half the recovery and minutely faster startup than the grounded version. Less invincibility and travel distance, and will lose to far more attacks. Used in air combos when too far for air SMS FRC, can be iffy as to which direction it blasts the opponent. Converts to 2H/6H afterwards, regardless of distance. Leads to crossup/fake crossup shenanigans by doing TK Saperia Trance at the end of blockstrings. Leads to whiff > throw after a max range 2S if TK'd. Both versions scale fairly high.

Damage Guard Startup Active Recovery On-Block Invuln   100 Mid 9+4 2 46 -14 1~15F All    Big damage, fullscreen punish and reversal tool. A very good just do it move. Leads to full conversions when close enough, making it very useful to hitconfirm from moves that don't lead to much by themselves like 5H or 2D. With FRC point can lead to combo from nearly fullscreen. FRC itself is also useful to make reversal safe and steal back her turn. Being a single hit its weak against puppets who can absorb it (e.g. Dizzy's fish) and may not lead to advantageous situation even when FRC'd. It is also slightly held back by pretty harsh 60% initial prorate, making it poor starter considering its use as a fullscreen callout.

Combos into for guts crush from many moves and can easily be made burst safe. Is not really good for damage otherwise as it gives opponent full tension bar and significant amount of burst back. While this can be alleviated by hitting it OTG, its still not recommended unless it will kill, with meter better saved for Nuke FRC instead. Doesn't knock down while opponent is grounded, which can put you in a bad position. Can be FRC'd to go for tick throws or another setup, since Imperial Ray is safe on block already.

Extremely close opponents will be sent flying upon activation. Justice will be vulnerable to hits while charging the beam attack. Opponents with low health/tension will die trying to block this. Costs a full tension bar. Uses 50% to activate and another 50% for the actual laser half of it. Can be FRCed after the initial hit if it whiffs or is blocked (Throw/Valkyrie Arc) > 6H > Gamma Ray will combo on everyone not named Flame of Corruption. Scales like hell off throw or VA, but does ludicrous damage off point blank 6H. A solid 50% or more off most of the cast's life with the confirm and the resources but only if very close. Everyone except Justice herself can get around this if done in neutral. Be sure to use it wisely.

Extremely risky with very little reward, as buffs she gains do not offset a chance to lose the round instantly. For the cost of 100% tension, Justice is granted a dash, three jumps, three airdashes, jump cancel on all normals except 5D, and airdash cancels on air normals, while also increasing her movement speed in general. Despite all of these buffs none of the combos available in Omega Shift deal more damage than you could do normally. Gives a full, flashing guard bar when it ends, along with a hefty recovery animation generously giving your opponent plenty of time to think up what cool combo they'll kill you with.
