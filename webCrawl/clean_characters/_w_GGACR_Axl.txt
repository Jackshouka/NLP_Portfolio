Based off of Guns N' Roses' own Axl Rose, Axl is a British goofball who has easily the highest range in the game. While his sickle normals are quite long, he's not a true zoner- think of him more like a mid-range pressure character. Axl has a large offensive toolkit to work with, boasting two crossup attacks, two counters, a frame-one autoguard move, and surprising damage potential regardless of where he is on the screen. While his close-range game is no slouch thanks to his multi-hit normals and long pressure strings, Axl's best feature is his long-range control, using moves like Rensen GekiGuard:MidStartup:12Recovery:39Advantage:-15 and Rashou SenGuard:UnblockableStartup:27Recovery:34Advantage: to try to bait you into jumping. Rensen Geki in particular is the lifeblood of Axl, being useful for pressure, combos, and even counterzoning by eating other projectiles. Once he's gotten you good and conditioned to try an air approach, Axl can anti-air you from far away and push you all the way back out. Simply put, jumping against Axl is very dangerous, since the rewards he get off of a good anti-air read are often very high. Axl can also be very dangerous up close thanks to his wide offensive toolkit, meaning that clever players can find Axl rewarding to play no matter where he is on the screen. However, when opponents have put Axl on the back foot, he begins to struggle. All of Axl's major reversal or defensive options carry risks. His reversal super is easy to bait, his Dead Angle is slow and has a bad hitbox, and his autoguard move is weak to lows and unsafe on block. With no real jab to speak of, Axl has to be very careful with pushing his opponents back out. Axl will often have to hold offensive pressure for a decent while before taking a chance to escape. As well, though Axl's chains are great at holding space effectively, they are very committal moves. Don't be careless with tossing them out if you value your life. Overall, Axl is a great character to pickup at all levels of play. His strong zoning, long pressure and powerful anti-airs make him great in the hands of a beginner figuring out +R or an expert who wants to flex their game knowledge.

Pros Cons   Big Normals That Vacuum: Several of Axl's normals have him draw the opponent in with his sickles and hit multiple times. This allows him to mount pressure from a distance very easily. Long-Ranged Pressure: Axl has great long-range grounded pressure tools, along with other tools to make the opponent impatient and jump, which is exactly what Axl wants. Incredible Anti-Airs: Axl's anti-airs are large, active, and have good reward making the air above him very dangerous for many characters. High Reward: Axl has very high reward when he lands a hit thanks to his great corner carry and damage, even off of a throw. His strong screen presence at both fullscreen and close up make him threatening at all ranges. Powerful Tech Traps: Axl's ability to bait and punish air-techs can be very rewarding and lead to big damage. Counter Zoning: Axl can counter most forms of zoning thanks to Rensen and his long, active buttons. Committal Neutral: Axl's long range buttons have very long recoveries and total frames. As a result every button press locks him into his decision for a very long time, and as a result a mistake can leave him open for a long time. Mediocre Mix: Axl's tools for opening up opponents tend to be very reactable, so at a high level his mixups rely on catching the opponent off guard with lots of conditioning. No Jab: Axl doesn't have a fast, safe thing to whiff like most characters (his fastest normal is his 6 frame 5K), and this also makes him very vulnerable to tick throws. Meter Hungry: Axl is strong and versatile with meter, but significantly more limited in ability to convert hits, maintain offensive momentum, or even play neutral safely without it. Unique Mechanics Held Buttons  Held Buttons Axl can hold down the attack button on his chain-sickle normals to skip the second hit of any of his multi-hitting normals. Used only for niche instances where you want to push the opponent out, or you're fishing for counter hits on the first part of the normal and don't want the second hit to ruin your confirm.

Situationally useful for punishing projectile startup. The extended hurtbox and high aim makes it a fairly weak poke for grounded neutral, and it should be used sparingly against grounded opponents who aren't extra tall. Gatlings into 6K and 2S, and the two hits make it easy to hitconfirm, so this is one of Axl's core starters for air combos.

One of the better normals to use in stagger pressure and tick throws. Gatlings into 5P, which helps a lot with air pickups when the opponent is close to the ground. Moves Axl's low hurtbox backward, allowing it to avoid low pokes when properly spaced. This is your fastest normal, but it's too slow to escape perfect tick throws, which makes Axl particularly vulnerable to them.

Good round start move, only directly contestable in a few matchups. Staggers on counterhit. This can allow some tricky situations with Rashou Sen, but also makes the hitconfirm into Rensen Geki more guaranteed. Can be low profiled under. f.S can be gatling'd into from 2P. This gives you more options out of 2P, or could withdraw 2P's hurtbox early for safety if 2P connects. If this move is done at typical spacing, cancelling it into a Rensen Geki will combo against a crouching opponent, but not against a standing opponent (unless counterhit).

Bounces on counterhit, making it rewarding in frametraps. Has some hurtbox shenanigans that often work like upper body invul, so it will occasionally trade favorably (especially on counterhit). At -2 on block, its one of Axl's safest ways to end a blockstring without an FRC. Raises guardbar by 20 points. 5H's main selling points are its damage, guardbar, and stun. Many of Axl's special moves have a lot of startup, and canceling from 5H is often the best way to make them harder to contest.

Its main strength is that it has huge range for a dust. Its weakness is that its tied with S Raei Sageki for Axl's slowest move (28F startup). 5D also has some lower-body invuln near the active frames, and can be used to call out lows pre-emptively. While 6H is usually preferred as an overhead due to faster startup and better nominal frame advantage, 5D is safer in many circumstances because it pushes the opponent further away and doesn't put Axl right in jab range in its startup. Axl can do a fake impossible dust combo (8jD-8jD-TK Bomber) from nearly any range, which can be converted into a bomber loop from pretty far from the corner. With the Axl Bomber FRC, it can also lead to a normal air combo midscreen. Fun Axl Fact: This move has so much range, it can make it hard to actually get the launch combo if it connects from too far away. You can sometimes fix this by using j.6P to pull them closer to Axl at the beginning when the screen flashes.

The hurtbox extends higher than 2S and the hitbox is tiny, so it's pretty bad as an anti-air, especially since Axl is a walking surface-to-air missile and any of his long range chain attacks will serve you better. Launches on counter hit and has the upper body invul, so it can occasionally work as a high-reward counterpoke, but 3[P] is much more effective for that and less likely to get you killed. Mostly serves as blockstring filler, adding some extra guardbar when you have the space to gatling it from c.S or 5K, and it's Jump-Cancelable, so it can add some tricks to your pressure.

His only chain move without any hurtbox on the chain. Only Axl's body can be hit during this move. Slow at neutral, but a great pressure starter if it connects. When used to start a blockstring at neutral, 3P offers simple high/low/crossup(S Raei Sageki)/Rahou Sen mixup, or frame trap/throw if you choose. Gatling Options: f.S, 2S, 5H, 2H, 6H, 5D, 2D   Don't trip. Confirm, or at least a knockdown, on counter One of the few instances where holding the button is often worth it. On counterhit, the first hit will pop the opponent into the air and the second hit will screw up your intended confirm, so if you can predict you're going to stuff something, you can give yourself more time to confirm by holding the button, and go into 2S or 5H, instead of unintentionally letting the opponent air-tech away. The 3[P] counterhit can also be used to fish for a knockdown at neutral.

This move serves two main purposes:  The first is to use this as necessary combo filler after anti-airing with 5P when they are too far away to go right into 2S. The second is doing it after a faked Rashou Sen to catch them trying to jump from fear of a real one. Just be sure they actually jumped or you could be in trouble for whiffing this move! Its also a long range anti-air that can catch people trying to jump, but it has a lot of cooldown, so its only recommended for this as a last resort when other anti-airs will miss. (5P is a better for catching jumps). You can get a combo directly from an anti-air 6K, but only with TK FB Bomber, j.K, or j.6P. Can chain back and forth with 2S to force an aerial opponent to spend a ton of meter FDing or catch them trying to tech. All of Axl's long range chains have a hurtbox and this is no exception. Don't stick a fork in the electrical socket.

Safest to do after 5H, but c.S and 3P are also good choices. Airborne between frames 11 and 31, so it can beat most low-hitting attacks if you read them correctly. If 6H lands as an anti-air, it can usually confirm into a combo. Hitting 6H late as meaty on wake-up gives you a big frame advantage, but can be reacted to with invuln reversals. Decent untech time, used for higher-damage air combo extensions. A great move to RC for pressure/combo extension. Moves Axl closer to the opponent (can help get you to preferred range for a matchup/situation). Can whiff entirely by jumping over some crouching characters if done too close. Will occasionally hit them as a cross-up (especially against Faust), but it's not very reliable.

Really bad hurtbox, so not very useful for neutral (Many 2Ps, 6Ps, and anything low profile will beat it clean from almost max range).

Jump-cancellable and pulls the opponent downward, so very important for converting into air combos. More untechable than 6K, allowing followups like j.H or j.D. Does not cover the range directly above Axl. Never use in situations where the opponent is falling straight onto Axl, such as when his back is to the corner and they are coming down along the same edge of the screen (At this spacing, your best anti-air option is probably airthrow or tenhouseki, but 5H also works if you have enough time to get it out).

Occasionally helps with spacing in air combos. Can gatling from j.S to preserve counterhits and avoid projectiles and guard counters trying to hit the j.S hurtbox. Often used falling as a relatively safe jump-in that can lead to j.K for a second overhead. At least we get a mashable jab in the air! Its a good air-to-air, and works for bringing them to the ground if you get them to block it. Jumping up and air-to-airing with this move can be a useful way to catch people trying to jump in when they expect 2P or try a weird angle that Axl's anti-airs have trouble covering. j.P gatlings into all of Axl's other air normals, so you have lots of options to confirm into a combo. If you anti-air or jump in with mash j.P near the ground, you can gatling into j.H → landing cancel, then continue the combo on the fly (5K, 2S, and 5P work well for the pickup). You can also set up a bomber loop in the corner with jump in>late air dash>j.P>j.D>H Axl Bomber. Mix this up with j.H safe jump and empty jump 2K so they'll never see it coming.

Best move to option select with is c.S. link into 5P, 6K, or microdash > 5K to confirm into a combo. Throw > Rensen Geki or Throw > FB Kyokusa Geki are burst safe kills. Be mindful of the corner when going for a throw. Don't miss a bomber loop because you threw them out of the corner. By the same token, don't get killed doing a non-os'd throw because you wanted the bomber loop too badly. 2K, 5K, c.S, and 3P are good moves for tick throwing. Some heavy or small hitbox characters, such as Johnny, Ky and Robo-Ky, require microdash > 5K to get the confirm.

Comes out in 4F, making it Axl's fastest attack. While not a real invincible DP, this is your go-to, fast, throw-invulnerable move that can potentially get the opponent off of you. Because the FRC point is so early, gatling into S Benten FRC is a way to quickly put Axl back to neutral for safety. Upper-body invuln comparable to some of the better 6Ps in the game. Invuln is only above the knees, so S Benten may trade or lose to some low profile moves. Its risky due to not being a real DP, but the partial invul allows S Benten RC/FRC to used as a frame trap. Good as a combo starter due to it launching and having an FRC point on frames 6-8 (after the hit). S Benten RC/FRC is a viable way to continue the combo if you don't have Rensen charged up. Sometimes trades with overheads, and can allow a meterless air conversion in this situation. Due to hitstop, this move's FRC has a hit and a whiff timing. It costs more meter, but you can opt to go for the whiff timing to make sure you either RC or FRC either way. H Version is a lower body invulnerable anti-air with a followup. Also throw invuln, so can sometimes be used to beat a low strike/throw mixup. Situational anti-air, but pretty slow to start up. The extension on the second hit covers a range somewhere in-between 6K and 2S. The chain part of this move's hurtbox doesn't go all the way up, so it may beat some things that Axl's other anti-airs lose to. The Axl Bomber followup is untechable for a long time, so this is a good meterless ender for air combos you want to knock the opponent down (This is good for when you don't want to spend meter on a prorated combo from throw or Tenhou Seki, or just want to keep your pressure in exchange for doing a bit less damage). H Benten RC can continue the combo if you don't have Rensen charged up, and raise the opponent's guardbar 40 points, while continuing your pressure if they block. You can opt to do H Benten at the end of a surface-to-air combo with Axl's long range buttons to get a burst safe kill.

Has an FRC point on frames 32-34. Stops Axl's air momentum completely, useful for air-to-air spacing. Air unblockable without FD, so it's a good harassment tool against aerial opponents. The FRC allows Axl to continue pressure or combos from the air, and can confirm into a normal air combo on a close hit or on counterhit from most ranges. Starts behind Axl in 7 frames, which makes it potentially strong as a crossup in okizeme or pressure - although this is hampered by 12 frames of landing recovery. Further followup from Axl Bomber continuation. Still has the FRC point, so can be used to be safer on a blocked H Benten. Situational combo extender, but you usually want to take the knockdown.

One of Axl's most important tools. FRC point on frames 15-16. Axl's farthest reaching attack. Hard knockdown most of the time, good for ending ground strings. Considered a projectile, and will stuff many other projectiles. Rensen can hit three times, which also means it absorbs up to three hits from another projectile, making it difficult to negate. Useful long range bullying tool if used carefully. The threat of Rensen can get people to jump, giving you a chance to anti-air them. Can catch people trying to hit the hurtboxes on long range chain normals. Good chip and OTG damage. Can be followed up with Kyokusa Geki or Sensa Geki from f41~62, so you have significant wiggle room to make it ambiguous. Works as a long range oki if you simply want to reset to long range neutral after a knockdown. The FRC point allows Axl to continue pressure from massive frame advantage and launch from most ground hits. Extremely important to making Axl threatening at long range and dealing with opponents who attack the hurtbox on long range chains. The FRC is a cornerstone of Axl's pressure and confirms, so it is absolutely essential that you master it.

Pulls the opponent slightly toward Axl, which can take them out of the corner and allows crossups on oki.

Not a lot of damage, but an essential tool for forcing people to jump. Much of the startup is low-profile. The projectile cannot be negated by other projectiles, and will simply pass through them until touching the opponent. Hitting the opponent puts Axl in an invincible throw animation, making this a great tool for getting through projectiles and traps. Can be feinted with P button. People get afraid of Rashousen.

Taking a hit during the active frames of Tenhouseki causes an invulnerable throw animation that crosses the screen and hits the opponent no matter what. Useful for dealing with crowded screens if you can bait a hit. Allows a full air combo, but it's scaled to 65%. Since the activation is essentially a guaranteed throw, it doesn't matter how many hits the opponent's attack has or if it's invincible. Great for catching reversals.

Jumps forward then hits below Axl. Can hit as a crossup or in front, depending on range. Doesn't stop momentum, so use it while running for more distance and ambiguity, or to land further past the opponent. Slides the opponent far away from Axl. This sliding state is long enough to pick up a full combo in the corner, but midscreen, it sends the opponent too far to hit with anything but max range rensen (too far to FRC and convert) without the FRC point. FRC point on frames 26-28, which is very versatile. It happens right at the start of the active frames, which helps make timing consistent, and Axl will be in the air on a successful FRC. If you jump install the move (Either in a string before it's performed or by adding an upward direction to the end of the motion from neutral), you can double jump or airdash afterward. This has a few major applications:  Mixup: Raei Sageki is already an ambiguous crossup, but the FRC adds another layer. With it, you can hit a different overhead (or two) while falling, or land and do a low or throw. If it's JI'd, you can also mess with timing with another jump, or airdash for another crossup layer with Kokuu Geki. Movement: Raei Sageki moves forward very quickly, and maintains your running momentum. You can use it a lot like Johnny's Killer Joker Transport FRC. Combo: With the last-frame FRC (or an RC), the attack will still hit, but Axl will be free to act in the air. This allows a midscreen conversion for considerable damage using airdash–j.H if you JI.

You can hold H to stay in the sky longer, and you can hold left or right to move around through the entire move. Useful for messing with the opponent's spacing, covering more distance, or making it cross-up ambiguously. Maintains running momentum, so it can travel almost the whole stage if done while running. RCing this move puts Axl on the ground almost immediately no matter how high you hit. This allows for a fairly easy conversion, and can put the opponent at frame disadvantage above you if they block it in the air. The leap upward is very fast, and will dodge a lot of attacks and then punish them. Axl's best way of catching opponents who can fly over his grounded AA kit, like Bridget. Axl is still considered to have traversed the horizontal space he covers, so this move can harmlessly trigger proximity-based traps like Testament's trees.

Stops Axl's momentum, hovers for a bit, then shoots downward, so it can screw with anti-airs and can be a gimmicky movement option. Does a ton of blockstun, so it can do a lot to maintain your pressure if you can get it out. Great way to continue a blockstring from the air. FRC point is pretty lenient and happens right as Axl lands. This enables conversions from midscreen, continuing pressure, and just being safer when you whiff.
