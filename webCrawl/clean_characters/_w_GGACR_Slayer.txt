Solid whiff punishes, great juking tools, Backdash Cancel (BDC), and his overall high strength at mid to close range make Slayer a menace once he really gets into the opponent's head. In particular, BDC allows Slayer to transfer the invincibility from his back (or forward) teleport dashes into his special moves. Not only does this give his offense additional prowess, it also allows him to circumvent blocking with one very powerful defensive tool. Slayer spends meter well, too: his supers are all very powerful and either start or extend combos, and his Force Breaks like Big Bang UpperGuard:MidStartup:10Recovery:35Advantage:-22 (236D) and FB PilebunkerGuard:MidStartup:3Recovery:31Advantage:-3 (Dandy Step > D) are terrifying threats in neutral or pressure. It's common to get more than 60% damage from a single combo if the starter is good. On the flip side, Slayer has limited gatlings as opposed to the rest of the cast, and is a bit reliant on links for real conversions. Lacking a run or a projectile, his mobility is more restricted than other characters and he has trouble dealing with zoning, and can easily eat it just as bad as he deals it if he makes a poor move. BDC can take quite a bit of time to perform consistently, and each of his special moves has a different use when combined with BDC. Slayer can be a make-or-break character, but his strengths are truly frightening, and one good read can give him the chance to end a round.

Pros Cons   High Damage and Stun: Slayer gets very high damage output from any of his confirms or singular attacks. If Slayer gets a counter hit or has meter to burn, he can skyrocket his damage to truly ludicrous heights and potentially earn a stun. Backdash Cancel (BDC): Slayer can combine his backwards teleport with his special moves to give them partial invulnerability, letting him do things like circumvent blocking, approach while invulnerable and frame trap opponents effectively. Excellent Buttons:  He has fantastic pokes in 5K and 2K, great anti airs in 6P and 2S, and many ways to reset pressure such as with 6K and c.S. Great Pressure: Slayer has very strong pressure with many ways to reset and punish opponents on a good read. After conditioning them to sit still, Slayer can open them back up with his fast command grabGuard:92 pixelsStartup:7Recovery:29Advantage: and crossup teleport dashGuard:Startup:Recovery:Total 30Advantage:. Whiff Punish God: Dandy Step followups, very rewarding counterhit buttons and incredibly strong overdrives all can effectively lay the hurt on a single punish.

Limited Mobility: A tall hurtbox, teleport dash, and short airdash means Slayer needs to juke around his opponents defenses to get in. His reliance on a physical approach also makes him weak against zoners. Limited Grounded Gatlings: Slayer is somewhat unique in that his grounded normals delay gatling into each other via links. As a result, much of Slayer's pressure and combos revolve around links, which can be tricky to execute in the heat of the moment. Counter Hit or Resource Dependent: While Slayer can vortex his opponents very well, his signature large damage potential relies on either having a good meter bank or a big counterhit to work with. Patient Workarounds: Most of his tools can easily be low-profiled, on top of some tools being unsafe if used haphazardly due to having obvious reactionary answers. Unique Mechanics  Teleport Dashes & Backdash Cancel Slayer's forward dash and backdash take the form of short-range teleports. These teleports transport him a fixed distance and have lots of invulnerability frames, which gives Slayer unique methods of moving around his opponent's attacks. Slayer can still airdash normally, however. As an added function, Slayer can jump in the middle of a teleport, which immediately exits it while keeping the invulnerability frames. With quick timing, Slayer can even Tiger KneeAn input method to perform a special move in the air as fast as possible after you leave the ground. Almost always abbreviated to TK. For Example: 2369 for a j.236 input. certain special moves to transfer them some of the invulnerability. Slayers backdash is fully invulnerable for 19 frames, which makes it very easy for Slayer to give any of his special moves large periods of invulnerability on their startup. This is called Backdash Cancelling by the community, and is a very powerful tool for Slayer to use. Correctly performing this allows Slayer to dramatically increase the whiff-punishment qualities of certain moves, reversal out of bad situations, or frame trap his opponents. More information on performing this technique can be found on the Strategy page. Starter Guide   Starter Guide Need help getting started? Go to this page for information targeted at new players. It covers easy combos, key moves, and what to do after you knock the opponent down. StartupThe time before an attack is active including the first active frame.

You can convert from the slide back to an air combo by connecting another move before the slide ends. When further away, 5H > 2H is a common conversion. When deep in the corner, 5H > Undertow is the higher damage option vs. an airborne opponent. 5H > K Mappa can sometimes hit, allowing for followups after K mappa. 5H > BBU will almost always work if you are in range, and 5H > FB Dandy > CWH can also pick up.

Quickly covers some horizontal space. Very short. Slayer's fastest meterless backdash-cancel option. Links into 2P or 5K on air hit. Links into BBU on counter hit. Generally fairly safe unless you end up point blank. BDC P Mappa (442369P) is amazing at harrasing opponents in pressure with it's quick startup, decent range, and invul transfer from the backdash. FDC P Mappa (662369P) can function as an in-between of K and P Mappa Hunch with the useful invincibility from forward dash. K version is the farther reaching punch with the same poor hitbox and reward on hit. Good for covering distance. Quickly covers good horizontal space. Converts into the same options as the P version Punishable on instant block or against characters with 3F normals, but properly spaced you can make this up to +2. BDC K Mappa (442369K) is great at going through pokes at farther range, or even going through projectiles in some occasions. FDC K Mappa (662369K) can cover near fullscreen distance, and the invincibility from forward dash can be used to go through projectiles and pokes as well. Feint Mappa is usually used for throw mixups or to get in on an opponent too scared to challenge. P version comes with short range, but can carry some momentum. K is good for getting in against overly respectful opponents.

Moves slightly forward from the initial position. Has a small amount of startup invincibility to make small moves whiff with. Has a FRC point that leaves you far. Varied followups that work well depending on the situation. BDC P Dandy (442147P) is great at beating short to mid range pokes, since the BDC will allow you to do follow ups at farther ranges backward than if you didn't BDC. FDC P Dandy (662147P) is useful as a pseudo reset or tricky movement option with decent invincibility throughout. K Dandy moves significantly forward from the initial position. Has a 6F of startup invincibility to make larger moves whiff with. Has a FRC point that leaves you even further away. Varied followups that work well depending on the situation. BDC K Dandy (442147K) is used when you really want to make something big whiff, the momentum from K Dandy carries you back to where you started though, so beware. FDC K Dandy (662147K) is also useful as a pseudo reset and a tricky movement option with a bit more invincibility and range.

Good for crossing up. Slayer's hitbox becomes very wide during the motion blur part of the animation. On it's own, S Dandy is useful as a surprising crossup or to go through projectiles. BDC (21447S) can give it some start up invincibility, and FDC (662147S) can give it a bit more range. H Dandy's distance and startup compared to S-Dandy increased. Good for escaping the corner or doing dumb things. A crucial tool in some matchups to go around projectiles BDC H Dandy (21447H) helps cover it's long start up with some invincibility. FDC H Dandy (66214H) goes almost fullscreen, giving a different approach to neutral.

Throw invincible, to discourage players mashing throw, but has to hit late since it loses invul on active frames. Occasional air combo ender. Avoid being predictable with this, as it can easily be reversal'd or backdashed through. Slightly faster when used after Under Pressure, but is +1 instead. Still a strong meaty outside throw range due to plus frames or a delayed hit to catch throw with its early throw invul. Floor bounces on counter hit, catching players who don't have a fast enough button between this and Under Pressure. Again loses to reversals and backdashes, with no real way to bait them other than not doing it.

Comes with the risk of being in CH state during recovery. Staggers on hit and will lead to combo/resets against people who don't mash. In case they do it has an FRC point to guarantee conversion. Regains health equal to 75% of damage, will occasionally make Slayer survive one more hit, especially if used at low health. BDC Bite (442369H) can be useful as a wakeup reversal, or on oki after a Dandy Step to throw people off with a strike invincible grab. FDC Bite (66236H) is mostly useful during pressure to catch people by surprise from a decent range. If you are too close you might cross up with your forward dash, making 66214H needed to hit the Bite.

Can be FRC'd right before it goes active to throw or net a different punish. Combos into sj.H > j.D > j.2K > j.K > 5H on counterhit. Can be used to counter a burst or dead angle attempt on a hard read. BDC (63214469H) can cover the startup of the armor with invincibility, but it's still slow.

Multi hit move which launches Slayer upwards, based on his aerial momentum when the move is input. Flies extremely far and fast if done in the starting frames of an airdash; good for escaping from the corner. Used to score a kill when the opponent has little health remaining. Horribly unsafe if done rising, as it does not recover until Slayer lands. Sometimes used as Slayer is falling in order to score a fuzzy or a launch.

A massive, lunging, 10F anti-air hitbox attack that launches well above the top of the screen for easy-peasy conversions. Has an absurd amount of upper body invincibility on startup, allowing it to squeeze under most moves in the game. High pushback makes it tricky to punish, but it still very unsafe and in CH state for most of recovery. Combos into itself repeatedly and can be made burst safe. Comes with the weaknesses of zero dizzy damage, that it cannot be special cancelled or BDC'd into, and is in full counterhit state during the entire move.
