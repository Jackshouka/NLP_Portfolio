Her biggest strengths are her explosive damage combined strong high/low mixup options. In place of her ground dash she has a unique hoverdash that makes her airborne, allowing her to use her aerial moves low to the ground for greater speed. When she makes an opponent block a multi-hit music note projectile either on knockdown or from neutral she can safely utilize her strong mixup options, and she can generally get unprorated damage if she has meter for optimal routes. This grants I-No some of the most dangerous okizeme in the game, which means she also has explosive comeback potential. I-No possesses weaknesses to offset her strong oki game, the biggest of which is the complexity of her neutral game. While her hoverdash is amazing for high/low mixup it is incredibly prohibitive for movement and pressure. Her normals and special moves are typically good at one specific job so you will be forced to guess more often than with other characters who can cover a lot of options with a few moves. Though her defense isn't as low as other characters such as Millia, I-No is just as susceptible to being dizzied. Eating a single counterhit from some characters can end the round in a loss, which discourages you from taking certain actions and can make you more predictable. Finally, she tends to struggle in matchups against characters who can consistently commit less than her in neutral. That said, landing a well placed counterhit in neutral, confirming the full combo, and succeeding on oki with an unproated normal can be enough to destroy squishy characters. Alternatively, if you can win neutral in even a small way to begin your offensive snowball I-No can reward you with repeated use of some of the most dangerous mixup and reversal baits in the game. Her mixup has more holes than Dizzy and Millia but you get way more damage when successful. Just how difficult is the character? You'll have to get good at the 632146 input because she uses it a lot. When you first start off you can get by with simple strings into knockdown and do most of your damage in the corner where it's easier, and you can also use her Force Break dive to take opponents to the corner quite easily. To use her full potential you'll need to learn to string several difficult things together back-to-back just to accomplish a single link.

Pros Cons   Vicious Mixups: Hoverdash for quick high/lows, TK overhead options, j.D and all of its associated techniques give I-No great overhead opportunities to condition opponents. Versatile Toolkit: HCLGuard:AllStartup:11Recovery:12+8 after landingAdvantage:+3 is a projectile reaching 2/3 screen that negates 1 hit of other projectiles while passing through them and remaining active. NoteGuard:AllStartup:19Recovery:Total 50Advantage:-11 can be controlled vertically and gains hits the longer it's on screen. Overdrives are safe on block and typically grant a full conversion on hit. High Tension Efficiency: I-No's hoverdash builds more meter than a standard forward dash. Her STBT and Dive special moves build lots of Tension on contact. She frequently only needs to spend 25% to reset pressure or start big conversions. Explosive Damage: Using optimized character-specific combos, I-No can deal incredibly high amounts of damage to the entire cast. She can also convert at surprising ranges thanks to HCL 6FRC6, though this requires tight execution. Superb Aerial Mobility: I-No has two air dashes and Sultry Performance to help her move around the upper half of the screen. FB Sultry Performance even restores her air options. Strong Backdash: Having the fourth longest total backdash invul in the game allows her to escape some situations other characters can't escape with their backdash. Hoverdash Restrictions: It has 9 startup frames, which creates difficulties in escaping some situations, inhibits certain types of pressure and weakens her throw game. â˜…High Execution Barrier: I-No has hard combos and advanced movement, which can make learning and piloting her difficult. Her low defensive stats make it very easy for her to blow up off of a single mistake. Low Midscreen Damage: Does little damage without spending meter or scoring the right Counter Hit at midscreen. Tricky & Committed Neutral Game: I-No's normals all have specific uses and often have a number of weaknesses baked into them, such as her lows not reaching low enough to crush low-profile moves. I-No's most difficult matchups tend to be the ones where her opponent can reliably commit less than her while also covering many of her options. This can come up against characters who have strong air tools since I-No cannot self-gatling on whiff with her j.P, and has the worst airthrow range in the game. Fragile: I-No has low defense, low guts, and low stun resistance. She may last longer than other squishy characters on average, but but she struggles with being killed easily in some matchups. A particularly bad counterhit can instantly stun her. Note: Tips for playing I-No on a leverless device (Hitbox) can be found by clicking this link. This is often considered very difficult, however like many other things on this character it is fine after some practice. A catalogue of all of I-No's advanced techniques with explanations can be found  here. This is not required for starting with I-No, but will be a good reference for learning how to perform these techniques. Unique Mechanics Hoverdash  Hoverdash I-No's dash is completely unique in that it makes her airborne starting on frame 4. The earliest she can act is on frame 10. Letting go of the dash will cause I-No to drop to the ground in an actionable state. While I-No's hoverdash can be tricky to get used to, successful operation allows her to endlessly loop mixup attempts and go for shockingly fast instant-overheads. More information on how to use   The fastest you can land is on frame 20, even if you whiff a normal (like j.H) to try to land faster. Hoverdash expands her hurtbox in all directions except down. She actually lifts significantly on frame 4, allowing her to dodge many low attacks. Starter Guide   Starter Guide Need help getting started? Go to this page for information targeted at new players. It covers easy combos, key moves, and what to do after you knock the opponent down. StartupThe time before an attack is active including the first active frame. For example, an attack with 10F startup means the attack will do nothing for 9 frames, then hit the opponent on the 10th frame. frames    ActiveThe active frames of an attack refers to the amount of time an attack can hit the opponent.

The combination of the very fast startup, lack of extended hurtboxes during startup, 4 active frames that are highly disjointed, and low recovery (with only 2 extended hurtbox frames during recovery) make this an amazing normal to use in neutral. You can chain several hits of 5P if you want to burst bait before starting your air combo. On block you can go into any of I-No's other moves or jump cancel, so her high-low mixup is on the table. An excellent normal to throw out when you want to preempt your opponent and stuff their pokes that have extended hurtboxes during startup frames. 5P is an effective anti-air when used properly. If your opponent jumps in with a deep/late air-to-ground to beat I-No's 6P, hit them first with this frame-4 move. If they start their jump-in earlier to beat a 5P, 6P will then work. If they try to feint a landing to bait 6P and double jump into their normal, they open themselves up to airthrow or 632146S. When both 5P and 6P fail against an opponent's air normal, 5K may be able to do the job.

Necessary for many combos and gatlings to most normals. Good mixup tool as the jump cancel lets you go into j.236K/S or j.D FDC for overhead options, or you can manual jump install and gatling to 2S/2D for low options. 5K > JI 632146K 6FRC6 is the standard punish after an opponent bursts badly. The long active frames will catch them falling so you don't drop your burst punish, but you can also use them to catch backdashes. Tricky to use as a poke, but highly effective when used right. I-No extends her hurtbox forward during startup, the hitbox shrinks inside the hurtbox for the last 4 active frames, and her hurtbox remains extended during recovery. If your opponent doesn't respect you and mindlessly pushes the wrong buttons in neutral, you can control space with the active frames and let them stick their startup hurt boxes into this attack, but if your opponent knows the matchup, or is mindlessly pressing the right buttons, you'll get blown up. I-No lifts her leg off the ground which could potentially dodge lows at the right range, but her leg can easily whiff over the opponent since the hitbox is so high. This move is an Anti-Air, not a low crush. From an air-CH up close you can confirm into TK j.236P, and if they're far away you can confirm with IAD j.H, with both setups leading to beefy meterless damage. From a ground hit, you can usually link 632146K for a 6FRC6 conversion, but some characters recoil in a way that prevents this setup at max 5K range even with the counter hit, and this wont work vs crouching either. If they're close enough you can manually JI and use 2D to float them into the 632146K to get your conversion. Otherwise all you can really do is link 2S for more damage or jump/special cancel and go for a possibly unexpected mixup. Fun fact: this move can actually dodge Slidehead during it's first 2 frames, but from my testing it's not actually airborne. Her hurtbox rises slightly on those frames, but not quite enough to dodge other low attacks like Slayer's 2H, so this is extremely situational.

Because it has 5 active frames, you have a little wiggle room to delay your chain and create a frame trap. c.S > delay 5H can lead to huge unprorated damage if they bite. It's not advised to try to antiair with this move due to the risk of accidental f.S, but it can work. Be wary that the range at which the game considers your 5S press "close" is relatively short, which can cause you to get f.S at nearly point-blank range and drop your combo. This is more common in the corner after an airthrow. Walk forward 1-frame before using c.S or go for 2K > c.S to work around this problem. There is a dead zone where f.S will activate, but whiff because you're too close... or because c.S doesn't activate from far enough away.

It's somewhat spammable, raises guard bar considerably (which is unusual for projectiles), nullifies single hit projectiles, and launches on hit. It's worth setting up frame traps with this move if your mixup attempt is blocked since it's +5 by default. Use this from far away to force the other player to go over or under it, then stuff that option with the appropriate normal (5H/2H if they go low, 6H or j.P if they IAD). If you're close enough that the first active frames would connect,  you're probably too close to poke with this unless you already have the initiative (frame advantage or knockdown). I-No typically uses 2S the way a lot of characters would use their f.S. Sometimes you'll opt to f.S on oki instead of using a note due to the time you have to set up. If the last few frames connect, you'll have so much frame advantage that you can dash in for your mixup with less fear of your opponent countermashing. At best +15 on normal block Your opponent would need to IB and counter-mash with a sufficiently fast normal (learn the matchups where you have to watch for this) or commit to a wakeup-invul move that you can bait. Occasionally a late f.S on oki will catch inexperienced players because it lingers longer than it looks like it should, so you should be ready for a non-CH confirm. Even when done properly on oki there would be a gap when you try to run your mixup, so work in frametraps to enforce respect here too.

Ground CH leads to a big beefy meterless combo now that you can jump cancel 41236H. This move also has enough hitstun that you can TK j.632146K from it, to attempt the "easier" version of 6FRC6 while you're still building your execution. When you're optimizing for damage you'll want to look for more ways to use this move since it's among I-No's higher damage attacks, and as a lvl 5 move it scales well. Now that 6P has a forced prorate you'll get more damage on 632146K 6FRC6 combos by skipping directly into 5H where possible (such as from c.S or 2S) and with jump install you can combo with JI 632146K 6FRC6 combo. Learn to frametrap into this move, and you can also try to crush your opponents' low hitboxes, but don't count on it to "just work" because of the airborne frames. She's not that high off the ground, but it's "good enough" to help her beat some normals in some matchups. Can be used against moves like Slayer's 2H, but it only barely makes a difference at max range vs his 2D. Can also help to blow up Slidehead from long distances. It's not all that fast and it has long recovery, so you can't throw it out mindlessly. Control space with your other moves, then crush low attempts with this move. This is one of I-No's better hitboxes, but she does extend her hurtbox forward slightly during startup. She also extends her hurtbox upward during startup, which is less of an issue since you don't AA with this move, but is still relevant in some matchups (EX: May's vertical dolphins may accidentally catch you using 5H).

Despite the range, this move is not a projectile and can be RC'd on hit or on block. Also, I-No is a goddamn contortionist if you look at the animation for this move. Unless you run into an opponent who doesn't have the recognition to block this, you should rarely use it just for the overhead property. It's worth using this as a zoning tool rather than trying to mix up your opponent with it, since it's active for a surprising duration and the hitbox is pretty wide. Use it when it's "safe" to do so, just to give your opponent one more thing to watch for. This makes it that much harder for them to block you in neutral or on defense. I-No extends her hurtbox forward slightly on startup, so the "safe" range really is from far away where you'd think no one would ever get hit. Use at around 2/3 screen distance when you read that they'll dash in (especially if you control space above them with a note), or time it meaty on oki if you think they're asleep, or occasionally in pressure strings when you're at long range (such as after 2S). When they think they can dash under max range 632146K to punish you, that's when this works. Be wary in some matchups as it's too risky to throw out 98% of the time (EX: Pot can Hammerfall through it, Baiken can terminator run through it, etc.). Even though the hitbox is big, there's zero reward on air hit (even on CH, though you can RC and link 5K > JI 632146K > 6FRC6 if you have 75% to burn), and due to scaling it doesn't lead to the greatest meterless damage unless you've cranked their GB. This also contributes to the move not being great to throw out.

It's also a staple in combos since it launches on hit, setting up most of her meterless air combo routes. Since the hitbox is out in front of I-No, this move is effective ground-to-ground when you want to blow clear through enemy pokes that don't reach low enough to hit I-No's legs. The long recovery makes this risky on whiff, but when successful you can generally confirm into f.S or 5H to get a combo going. Since this hitbox is low to the ground, you'll find some characters can space their jump ins such that their hurtboxes remain too high to make contact with, so they'll land and block before this move hits them. As an example, Sol can do this with j.P and j.H. You'll have to work around this with IB > ground throw, preemptive airthrow, preemptive j.P, or 632146S when you encounter an opponent who spaces their jump ins correctly, but if they're off by a little bit you can still tag them.

If you're using this move in neutral you're typically fishing for an anti-air CH, which can be followed up by a meterless corner carry combo. The extra hitstop on air counter-hit sets up for a meterless corner carry air combo, but a ground CH (2nd hit) staggers so you'll generally need to spend meter to get a reward off of that (typically via 632146K 6FRC6). It has a special late gatling (which can be performed on whiff) to 5K that can let you confirm in the corner when the first hit connects and combos into the second, or if the second hit connects raw but wasn't a CH (both instances will require meter but lead to unprorated damage). This move is very high risk due to the long total duration, but can be worth using if you control space well with I-No's other normals. If your opponent tries to IAD on you and you have the precision to snipe them out of the air with 6H (2nd hit), it's worth the reward. It's also worth discouraging your opponent from IADing in mindlessly since it keeps them on the ground where your much safer 5H/2H options are effective. In most matchups you're better off going for a safer option like j.P or reactionary 6P, but in some matchups you'll get away with 6H more than you would expect.

This move actually doesn't have all that big of a hitbox, so it's pretty situational as a poke. 90% of the time you have a better option. You're pretty much only going to use this to set up traps and pressure, or for specific whiff punishes. You'd use it when 5P is too high and 2K is too low, but also when 6P is too slow and risky (since it does a better job of covering that space). Use this for whiff punishes where you would normally use 2K, as 2K prorates slightly harder. Example setup: Sol uses Bandit Bringer and you perfectly time a 2K under it. There are exactly enough frames to go for 2K or 2P in that scenario, and since Sol is crouching under 5P during those frames, 2P is your best damage punish if your timing is on point (otherwise you would throw him). Tick throw from this until they decide they don't want to be thrown anymore, then frame trap from it. This gatlings to 2H with a 1-frame gap, so you can frame trap players who like to mash after conditioning them with tick-throws You can gatling to 2S to catch players who try to jump when they expect the tick-throw. 2P > slight delay 632146K could also be used to great effect as a frametrap for huge meterless damage in the corner if you think your opponent will try to throw you out of your own tick-throw setup.

It cancels into 5H, 2H, 2D, and 632146K (Horizontal Chemical love/HCL). It also has the added bonus of having no proration at all, so as a combo starter this move can lead to ludicrous amounts of damage. Since I-No's f.S is rather unusual for a far slash, you'll use 2S in a lot of situations where other characters would use their f.S to force their opponent to respect their space. And fortunately for I-No, we control a lot of space with this move. Score knockdown by combing into 632146K where you can, but don't go for it if you hit a crouching opponent, or at ranges where you know 632146K wont combo. Learn to take the small damage and go back to neutral. In neutral you can use it after performing an empty hover dash (or dash to whiff j.H) then use 2S as you land to catch the opponent blocking high. You can also 2S to catch the opponent trying to run forward or jump at the wrong time. If you're too far away they'll know that the only options you have to hit them are 2S or 632146K (632146K whiffs if they crouch, and they need to crouch block the 2S anyway), so be smart about how you use it, and know that forcing your opponent to respect it opens up other options in neutral. 2S is a common burst point, but if they burst the 2S hit without confirming the startup of the next move, you can just wait after the 2S and block the burst. You generally need at least 25% to confirm with 632146K 6FRC6 into max damage, but a 40% combo off of a low is totally worth it. Remember that you cannot jump cancel 2S so you would need to carry a jump install from somewhere else. Explanation for  jump install and I-No specific  632146K 6FRC6. You still have your jump install for a few frames when landing (after a hover dash or empty jump). You can manual jump install from 5K and c.S. Turns out that if you attack on the first frame of exiting blockstun you'll have a jump install. This could lead to I-No getting some amazing punishes after forcing the opponent to whiff with FD.

It can also burst bait with the low profile frames, but this rarely works due to bursts having more active time than this has low profile time. You'll mostly use this when 5H is just barely a little too slow, or as a frametrap mid blockstring that then resets into another frametrap via +frames. I-No's hurt box extends up as she raises the guitar over her head, then out in front before she slams it, so she's more vulnerable in front of her body than when using 5H. Once she's active she should be low-profile and has a better hurtbox. The hitbox reaches very low to the ground which makes it suitable for hitting low profile moves, but it's not suitable for attacking above the enemy's knees if they have lower body invul.

This move is difficult to challenge when spaced correctly. A major drawback to this is that I-No is in counter hit state until all (61?!) recovery frames have ended, meaning any whiffed throw attempt can be especially deadly for her if you don't use an airthrow OS. I-No extends her hurtboxes along her legs before the hitboxes go active. Contrary to popular belief, this move does not cause I-No to land any earlier than normal when used out of a hover dash, though you can still be ambiguous about whether or not you're going to j.H or land into 2K.

Can fastfall this move when used during specific frames of I-No's airdash (similar to FF j.632146S), and if the airdash is done at the right height you can even jump cancel the landing recovery. j.D FDC can be used to alter I-No's vertical air movement without using the full animation of the attack, canceling it on the 2nd or 3rd frame into FD or SB.

However, I-No's hover dash is still an excellent tool for chasing techs and setting up airthrows. Wall bounces. Untechable. You should block bursts for an unprorated punish rather than going for the throw. However, the only punish for a gold burst is an airthrow, and I-No gets a combo afterward in the corner. This is less likely to happen with the reduced airthrow range, but it's possible to catch backdashes with airthrow. Is it a dropped combo? Or a reset? A weaker player can be mentally destroyed almost entirely by throwing their techs repeatedly. Get the corner airthrow, get your basic confirm into some damage, then reset into a throw attempt instead of taking the knockdown. While that may not work on skilled players, it's an easy way to beat the weak, so you can save your focus for harder opponents. Due to the high damage for an individual hit, airthrows contribute highly to I-No causing dizzy/stun. Airthrow resets also contribute to dizzy because you avoid the temporary boost in dizzy recovery over time from knockdown, and also go right back into damage without having to open the other player back up (while they're recovering). You can set up a guaranteed dizzy against a handful of characters off of one CH at round start into a meterless combo into a reset.

Due to the startup on the dash, an opponent on defense can simply stand there and jab I-No out of whatever she's doing. Dashing forward with this character is a risk, but the ability to dodge lows while moving forward has it's perks, along with the ability to do 14 frame overheads. Just remember that where everyone else can dash break or attack in a few frames and not have to commit to moving forward, you'll need to buy I-No a wedding ring every time you make her hover dash. Learn to walk. Feet are off the ground on frame 4, and her hurtbox shrinks upwards allowing her to dodge most low hitboxes. 9 frames of startup. The fastest you can start acting is on frame 10. The fastest you can land is on frame 20, even if you whiff a normal (like j.H) to try to land faster. Hurtbox expands in all directions (except down) when hover dashing. Character origin/collision is well below I-No when hover dashing, which affects her ability to airthrow. I-No can actually airthrow Faust out of pogo due to her low character origin, even though his origin is on the ground. Sometimes you'll want to stop hover dashing to adjust I-No's character origin upward and increase the chances for your aithrow to work (going for throw with 4H instead of 6H will do this for you). Sometimes you'll also want to jump out of the hover dash to chase a jump or double jump.

Good for setting up resets (using the stagger) if you combo this from 5H/2H against a crouching opponent. Sometimes you'll go for this because 2D wont reach (and neither will 632146K because crouching). It's possible to shake the stagger in time to block 632146K or to mash against dash-ins, so you'll need to condition your opponent to give you openings.

Has 2 FRC points and can be used to surprise your opponent with an instant ground grab, or 6FRC6 out of one of the FRC points and hover dash into an overhead attack. Due to the long startup it's risky to use in pressure situations, even when you're trying to call out specific attacks. However, you can condition your opponent to try to poke or DP out, and feint with FRC to backdash, or FRC to super, or FRC to block into punish.

I-No can control the vertical movement of the note during its entire duration, and can FRC to move in tandem with it. The P version starts off slow and speeds up with time, being great for corner oki situations. The H version starts off quickly and gradually slows with duration, so this version is more suited to long range situations and after moves that put the opponent far from I-No during their wakeup, such as a 632146K or her ground throw. Both versions gain additional hits depending on the time it is out and distance traveled up to a maximum of 5 hits. The air version is notably less recovery than the grounded version, with 4 extra FRC frames to cancel (total of 6). Decision of which to use depends on which knockdown you used, and how far away you are from them. Also, you can vary which version to affect how many hits the note generates, creating mixups and unpredictability. EX: Shoot H note where it will whiff, but P note would have worked, then throw. If you're trying to counter-zone another character that has effective projectiles (Venom, Ky), you can use P note at long range since it'll build up more hits before it reaches mid screen, then block the other player's projectile with it and let the note's explosion control space for you.

It's possible to knockdown with j.236P, but it's really hard. If you do, you'll be far enough away that FB Note has 10 hits, which is enough to crank GB to flashing. Also enough distance for either P or H note to hit 3 times, creating gapless oki. j.236K is a divekick style overhead attack which when performed as low to the ground as possible, results in an 18 frame overhead (K/S versions). j.236K knocks down on regular hit, but on counter hit it causes floor slide which you can confirm with 5H into an IAD combo (meterless) or JI 632146K 6FRC6 (better damage). Safer to use than S version since K version has better recovery. Sometimes you can TK it low to the ground for the + frame, then TK another Kdive to fish for a CH (or at least get a knockdown and get oki). j.236S has the same startup/overhead timing as K version. Launches on hit, but prorates 80%. At super jump height, the move travels more than full screen and coupled with a RC gives her a relatively useful get-in card in some matchups. On block, you can follow up a K/S dive with RC into S dive for a really scummy mixup. If you go into j.D you'll carry the forward momentum, so depending on timing you'll either hop over them and fly to the other corner to escape, or you'll bounce right in their face. You can try to airdash following the dive, but it puts you so low to the ground that you'll probably screw up due to the minimum airdash height requirement, so you'd really only be able to do this following a dive that made contact way too high on your opponent (which would have been unsafe, so your opponent is probably trying to mash jab or something and may hit you out of the dash). j.236H is a pseudo psycho crusher style move with an FRC point at the end. Has limited use in some matchups and in character specific combos. In +R its movement speed was increased, and recovery was shortened. When spaced at nearly-max to max range and TK'd as low to the ground as possible, this move has a static difference of 0.

The Horizontal version extends approximately 2/3 screen forward (with the camera zoomed out!) and about half screen behind her (can get some silly confirms off of crossups). In counter hit state throughout entire moves duration. The move's name is frequently abbreviated as "HCL." Be careful throwing this move out recklessly midscreen, as various characters can run underneath the wave and punish her. In +R, the hitbox was vastly improved reaching downward at her body, making the spam of this move on a cornered opponent a deadly trap tool as well as a high/low mixup starter when combined with its FRC point. Since this is frame-1 airborne, use this to bait throws on oki. If they know how to IB you'll get thrown easily if you don't FRC, or they'll poke out and force you to block, but if they don't IB it you'll have a frametrap to work with. However, if you want to try to crush a low on wakeup, you'd want to use 632146S instead (and even that doesn't work well against lows that were used meaty on oki). Using 632146K's FRC point does not give I-No her jump options, so you will need to jump install to use her best conversions. Though you can play I-No well without having 632146K 6FRC6 in your pocket, you will eventually want to learn how to do it. Dash momentum Horizontal Chemical Love (DM 632146K) can be done by canceling dash startup into 632146K. You should get forward momentum without seeing or hearing the effects of hoverdash. The input is 632146 56K. This technique has many uses, and some uses for DM 632146S. DM 632146K can be used in neutral to fish for a CH and go into a meterless corner carry combo, or in the corner for huge meterless damage. However, this technique is easy to screw up and the hitbox is rather thin vertically unless I-No is right on top of her opponent, so you'll get blown up for using it willy-nilly. Since you move forward there are situations where 632146K would have normally lost an exchange, but instead the momentum carry scores you a CH. Example: Round start vs KY, if he does 2S he will low profile your 632146K and punishes your recovery. If you do DM 632146K you score a CH and can link c.S, allowing you to combo him into the corner with 35% of his health missing. You can end a blockstring with frame advantage (f.S or 2H) and frametrap into 632146K extend to close the distance and keep the pressure on. The air version is pretty much a combo tool, but it recovers before landing now so it's less risky to air-to-air with.

This move will cause I-No to fast fall when used during airdash frames, and will carry forward momentum from a ground dash. If done during a low hoverdash into airdash (66956), it will be more advantageous the later into an airdash you do it. When FRCâ€™d from the ground, it will leave I-No temporarily airborne, which can be turned into un-reactable mixups utilizing falling overheads, low attacks and instant air dashes out of the FRC point if you are jump installed. Dash momentum 632146S has far more limited in use than DM 632146K, since you're moving yourself forward on a long and committed animation that doesn't have a hitbox in front of you. You would mostly use it for some sexy combos such as CH 41236S > DM 632146S > c.S, or j.D > j.H (impossible dust) > j.236 (whiff and land) > DM 632146S. High damage and great for racking up dizzy. Both versions of Chemical Love are airborne from frame 1, but it seems like I-No lifts herself off the ground a little earlier with this one, and since the hitbox reaches to the ground when used on the ground, 632146S is the better choice to try to stuff lows. I-No is in CH state 1~21F. If the opponent runs oki with a low and is a frame late or more (not a true meaty) you can crush them with reversal 632146S, and if you FRC you can convert that into unprorated damage. Most 2Ks or 2Ds will get crushed in this manner so long as they're as little as 1-frame late, but if they go for 2P (tick throw setup) you'll get stuffed due to the higher hitbox. Reversal 632146S should be used sparingly since your opponent could just git gud and meaty properly. That said, it's extremely sexy to Reversal DM 632146S and escape the corner while scoring knockdown. Main use of the air version is for Fast Fall Chemical Love combos. This move can now recover in mid air, and from double jump or super jump height it gives I-No enough time to link to airdash j.K. This new use enables meterless corner carry and some fancy corner combos. You can also be silly by trying to hit people directly below you with it.

Forces guard gauge to start flashing (+80 GB) when both notes are blocked full screen. At 10+ blocked hits, their guard bar will flash. If you score a knockdown with 50% meter, the ensuing combo from a blocked 214D on oki can be extremely high off of an unprorated mixup tool (j.S/2S). If you want to force a burst, use this move on oki. Public Service Announcement: This move is amazing. Please don't forget that some characters have answers to it. Don't use it as a crutch either: learn to neutral for real, then add this move in when and where it's a good idea. Unlike regular note, the air version has faster startup than the ground one. Fastest possible TK attack has startup of 16F, 36F total duration.

Can cancel FOR FREE by pressing a button at any time from frame 6-60, ensuring you get your combo, or take their burst. Strike invincible on frames 6-9 which helps you AA jump-ins that I-No normally can't counterpoke. Has an amazing hitbox, to the point where you might not even need the strike invul frames to beat things clean if you're able to start early enough. Can hold on startup and cancel before letting it rip to reset air options without actually using the move, meaning you can do this as many times as you have meter for it! Activating this move (even if you hold it) stops all air momentum, so you can: TK FB Dive > confirm they stood there > Cancel > falling j.K or j.H (punish them for jumping, or for not jumping) Airdash string > FB Dive > cancel > another airdash string (because we can) On oki, 66956 dash into j.K, but then FB Dive > cancel > low (condition with 3/4/5 overheads, then sneak in lows) Dash in mixup > j.D > dj.D > FB Dive > cancel > j.D > dj.D > etc (Your mixup should be as freaky as I-No's pillow dancing) Commit less with your air movement and become safe where you shouldn't be. The most important part of this move is that you can stop it at anytime with a button press. Stop on hit, or on block, or on whiff, FOR FREE.

You can combo into it easily, but you're generally better off going into Fortissimo if you want to spend your meter like that. You can combo out of it in the corner, or in some cases if you spend meter on 5K JI 632146K 6FRC6 follow ups. Note: The hitbox on this attack does not reach all the way to the ground.

This super does a LOT of damage, and combos both ways willy nilly. If she combos off of a raw hit, expect to lose 50% of your lifebar. I-no will wreck your shit with this move. Fortissimo hits the opponent 3 frames before they leave superflash, meaning they mostly can't input anything before the hit. If your opponent wasn't already blocking or invul, they're getting hit. If your opponent was even partially invul (like from 6P), they're probably trading or beating you clean. With nearly half a second in frame advantage on block, I-no gets to go for another mixup if it's blocked and even if it's slashbacked due to the huge amount of hitstop.
