No matter the style, Sol rewards players with a good grasp of Reads. Sol has decent footsies potential, but his party really starts once he is in close range — once he's close enough to make the opponent block 2PGuard:MidStartup:5Recovery:4Advantage:+2 and 2SGuard:MidStartup:10Recovery:8Advantage:+3 he can enforce his offense. Sol has wide cancel windows and flexible gatling options which let Sol create frame traps and mix up timings. If Sol can get the opponent to attack into a frame trap, or to take his command grab, Wild ThrowGuard:70 pixelsStartup:4Recovery:31Advantage:, then he gets to decimate their lifebar with his iconic SidewinderGuard:High/AirStartup:9Recovery:Until landing+13Advantage: Loops. Sidewinder is a satisfying, rewarding, and fun button to land which acts as the big reward for playing Sol well. The combos which use it are very specific, but reward so handsomely that Sol frequently routes into it. Sol is usually played with one of two opposing ideologies. There's the fundamental Sol who leans into the frame traps and patience, and there's the "Kusoru" Sol — the Sol who uses hard reads and unexpected attacks like Riot StampGuard:High/AirStartup:9 after reaching wallRecovery:3 after landingAdvantage:-4~ and Ground ViperGuard:Low×7, MidStartup:17Recovery:37Advantage:-21 and more to overwhelm the opponent's mental stack, or die trying. Whichever camp you might choose to side with, Sol has a few moves that are universally helpful. Volcanic ViperGuard:MidStartup:5Recovery:29+10 after landingAdvantage:-43 is a fantastic DPDragon Punch A move that has invulnerability during its startup, long recovery, and a rising motion. that allows Sol to disrespect and challenge gaps in the opponent's offense and force them to play around it. Gun FlameGuard:AllStartup:21Recovery:Total 50Advantage:-3, especially when paired with FRC, is a good projectile that rewards Sol greatly on counter hit and helps him re-buy his offense. Finally, Wild Throw gives Sol a rewarding way to crack an opponent who is content to hold his frame traps. Mastery of these tools, as well as his character specific combo routes, lets you pilot a powerful and expressive character.

Pros Cons   Slugger: Sol's close range options, such as 2P, +3 on block 2S,  Volcanic Viper, and Wild Throw are scary tools. His frame traps and counter hit conversions are incredibly damaging in skilled hands and can usually score a knockdown to set up another favorable sequence. Strong AbareAn attack during the opponent's pressure, intended to interrupt it. : Sol has a lot of good ways to contest the opponent's advantage. Sol has staples such as a 3 frame anti-air 5K and Volcanic Viper, as well as tricky evasive options — 2D and Ground Viper are incredibly low profile, and Riot Stamp in the corner can catch people off guard by high profiling their attacks. Scary Conversions: Sol's pokes, namely f.S and 5H, are all around solid and have great conversions into combos. Even his riskier option, Ground Viper, leads to such terrifying damage on clean hit that people can be forced to respect the option. Expanded Cancel Windows: 6P, 2H, 6H, 2D, and j.D can be cancelled during their recovery frames, which can be used to bait a response and punish with a frametrap. Slippery: Sol has a variety of options that can make him quite hard to pin down. j.P and j.H shrink his hurtbox drastically, which make anti airing a struggle for most characters. This is only complemented by Riot Stamp and Grand Viper, which allow sol to Low CrushA move that avoids low attacks. The move might pull your hurtbox up a bit so it avoids attacks that are low to the ground. In games with attack attributes such as Blazblue this is done with Foot attribute invulnerability. and Low ProfileWhen a character's hurtbox is entirely beneath an opponent's attack. This can be caused by crouching, certain moves, and being short. respectively. To cap this off, Sol's air hurtbox is also notoriously difficult for many characters in the cast to combo. Unimpressive Okizeme: Although his reward for landing a combo can be quite high, Sol's actual mixup game isn't particularly special. A lot of his scariest pressure ties into frame traps and punishing the opponent's decisions. Outside of frame traps, Sol usually relies on basic safe jumps or FRC Gunflame to help keep the pressure on. Funky Neutral: In order to bypass the pokes of characters with better footsies, Sol may have to lean on riskier approach options. Fortunately, the reward for being correct is suitably high. Limited Blockstring Pressure: Sol will generally need to spend meter to keep the heat on, and will tend to prefer going for the mixup fairly quickly. Unique Mechanics Clean Hits  Clean Hits Some of Sol's moves change properties depending on how they hit the opponent. Sol's damage output comes from Clean Hits, which involve hitting the opponent at a position specific to the move in question, the opponent, and the opponent's position. Clean Hits are always optimal. They lead to better combo extensions in every instance. The damage bonuses to Sidewinder and Force Break Tyrant Rave allow Sol to deal over 50% damage to the opponent off of one conversion. During a combo, Clean Hits become harder and harder to land as the number of Clean Hits increases. This resets after the combo ends (though bursting does not reset the count, leading to situational but absurdly damaging burst punishes). This means that the fourth Clean Hit will need to be more precise than the first Clean Hit, for example. Four moves deal clean hits: Sidewinder, Grand Viper, Bandit Bringer, and Force Break Fafnir. Landing a Clean Hit with any one of these changes the effects of the move:  Sidewinder: Doubled untechable time. Damage increases with the number of Clean Hits per combo. The cornerstone of Sol's most damaging bread and butter combo. Ground Viper: Increased untechable time, leads to a full combo. Launches higher. Bandit Bringer: Floats slightly higher, increased untechable time. Force Break Fafnir: Floor slides as opposed to regular knockdown. Full conversions near the corner. Force Break Tyrant Rave: Does not have a clean hit, but gains a damage boost based on clean hit count similarly to Sidewinder.

On air hit, 5K is confirmed from with 2H or a j.P/j.K into a sidewinder loop or an aircombo into VV knockdown.

Pushes Sol's hurtbox pretty far forward, CH state for the whole move. Has a difficult confirm into Grand Viper if it counters on the first hit. 6H will get counter hit very easily if used poorly. It is more difficult to contest in the air though, so air CH confirms lead to Bandit Bringer. Be very cautious about using this move.

Fast enough to combo off of level 1 buttons. Special cancel window extends into its recovery frames. Can be OS'd with 5P/2P to bait bursts mid combo. On counter hit, a Bandit Bringer will convert, and will whiff and recover if they burst. Can work as a risky preemptive anti-air, and late frame trap tool.

Near-corner conversions into FB Fafnir when too far for regular meterless juggles to work. Can combo to Clean Hit Grand Viper on normal hit against Jam, Bridget, Millia, and Kliff. Further applies to May and Baiken near the corner, or if 3 or more hits precedes the 2D. Leads into Bandit Revolver RC for a conversion.

Active for long enough that when dropped on them on oki, they must either block or attempt a reversal. Will cover Sol's approach with an FRC. This FRC also resets pressure and Sol's position when done close enough. Does high damage in combos, especially in the corner. Can be jumped over, but the FRC lets you react and catch them. Counter hit state for the entire duration, making the FRC vital. Note: When GF is cancelled into, the FRC window will be delayed mid-string due to hit/blockstop. Advanced tech: Gunflame can be combo'd into against a grounded, crouching opponent, by cancelling into GF from a level 5 move, FRC'ing it, and linking an, at slowest 5F normal before the Gunflame goes active. E.g: xx > 2H > GF FRC > 5P > (GF hits) > xx Very useful tool when used properly.

The greatest. Ever. 623S: Lower to the ground version. Can be canceled into the followup kick on whiff to mix up Sol's recovery timing. Converts to knockdown about 95% of the time. Leads to a full conversion if the first hit is RC'd, or if the 2nd part counter hits. Tied for the slowest version of the move at 7F, but with some of the most invulnerability. Note - all grounded versions: must be jump installed in order to airdash or double jump on RC. Used to anti-air in situations where no other anti-air works. Breaks through even the smallest gaps. Using the knockdown kick sets up oki, but on whiff/block, the followup puts you in CH state. Commands respect in order to be completely baited. 623H: Massive DP version. Big Anti-Air callout, unrivaled in combined speed and vertical reach. Eats up the sky. Slightly faster and more damage than the S version. Similarly converts if the 1st hit is RC'd or the 2nd part counter hits. Can be difficult to punish if done with running momentum: some characters lack the means to reach Sol without meter. Leniency to the followup is slightly more difficult, and must be delayed a bit.

Has the most leniency into combo'ing into the followup kick of any air VV. Also works as an air reversal, but is air blockable without FD, and is only strike invuln. Completely cuts Sol's air momentum when you RC the first hit, leading to airdash mixups or continued strings on block. This RC will make Sol fall straight down. You can TK this move and RC it immediately, and with some very tight timing, you can tag an opponent with a quick overhead before you hit the ground... Can convert to longer combos if the first hit is RC'd. j.623H: Situational air knockdown tool with slight more damage. Higher reaching aerial VV, but not as high as the grounded version. Can get air knockdowns sometimes where j.SVV wouldn't, particularly on lighter characters. Also air blockable without FD. Lacks the same leniency to the followup as the ground H version.

Leads to a safejump setup on knockdown. Minute startup invul can make it a pseudo-reversal. Keeps opponents grounded, though throw punishable if blocked standing. Use caution: the second hit is unsafe on hit if the opponent is (still) grounded. Combo filler for high meter gain, and tool for shooting across the stage. Converts stray air hits into longer combos. Loops from 5K and c.S, mainly for corner carry and meter gain. Can be FRC'd before going active to propel Sol forward. Second hit has extended untech time, allowing for longer BR loops and KDs where the 3rd hit would make it impossible. FRC also used to extend aerial pressure strings, combos, or set up mixups. Main conversion tool out of farther hitting j.Ds where SW Loop isn't possible. When close to the opponent, can be TK'd to start a longer combo.

Large ground bounce makes conversions extremely easy. Works best off of Gunflame FRC in the corner, works off of max-range, crouching CH 5H against most of the cast. Has a Clean Hit, with no forced prorate. Occasional FRC use leads to unusual mixups. Can also be RC'd on contact if Jump Installed for an airdash mixup. This move can work well to catch some fuzzy backdash attempts, and it can be very hard for some characters to 6P. As a result, one must usually IB Airthrow it or risng j.P in orther to beat it, IB Throw works depending on the range.

Leans forward during startup, letting Sol move past some hitboxes depending on spacing (e.g. Dead Angles) +3 on block with very little pushback, still good for tick throws. Can lead to Dustloops, Sidewinders, and TK Bandit Revolvers. Mid-corner combo against airborne opponents, can be jump canceled into a j.D for a high damage Sidewinder or Dustloop.

Works with 5 in a row in one combo with a 3-hit prior starter. Teyah them to death.

Bandit Revolver loop leads to 15-20% damage, more meter, and knockdown. Sidewinder Loop does similar damage with [5K > j.P > j.K/j.S] or [5K > 6P > 2H > j.S/j.D] > SW. Compared to Wild Throw, it's faster, safer (when OS'd), and is a reversal, but doesn't have WT's conversions or knockdown.

The greatest. Ever. Ground S: Weaker version of VV, but has some altered utility. Similarly strong hitbox, but cannot cancel into knockdown. Same speed as regular SVV, but slightly less damage overall. All three hits must be FD'd if airborne. Overall not the strongest version, but usable. Ground H: The hype machine. One of the meanest moves in the game. Absolutely massive wall of hitbox. Reaches to the top of the screen. Does double dizzy damage (1st hit), takes a buttload of health, and can still convert to knockdown. The 1st hit does 60 damage and GB -1: one of the single strongest combo starters in the game on RC. Air: Similarly weaker version as DI SVV, but the first hit is air unblockable. Doesn't cancel to knockdown. First hit being air unblockable can win you air-to-air wars. Fully invincible compared to normal air VVs being only strike invincible. Will work if they don't FD while air poking in blockstrings, but otherwise you should use with meter if you want to convert.

Knocks down with a bit of pushback for ending combos when DI is about to run out. Leads to a safejump setup on knockdown. Minute startup invul can make it a pseudo-reversal. Combo filler for high meter gain, and tool for shooting across the stage. Converts stray air hits into longer combos. Loops from 5K and c.S, mainly for corner carry and meter gain. Can be FRC'd before going active to propel Sol forward. FRC also used to extend aerial pressure strings, combos, or set up mixups. Main conversion tool out of farther hitting j.Ds where SW Loop isn't possible. When close to the opponent, can be tk'd to start a longer combo.

One of Sol's weirder attacks, but can be useful to surprise your opponent if they aren't ready for it, allowing to get in or an occasional conversion. On the other hand, this move is infamously easy to 6P, which can lead into a full combo on a good number of the cast. Don't throw this move out like it's nothing or you'll explode. Hits on 14F when cornered, but will push out a lot of the cast and go right over some of them crouching. Starts higher off the ground the further you do it from the corner. Airborne on frame 1. That and the high profile will get you out of Dodge against low hitting moves or against characters with limited air knockdowns (very good vs Dizzy fish setups for example) Doesn't normally lead to anything on hit, but full conversion on midscreen counter hit. Can be FRC'd right before it goes active to fake into a low, or right as it hits (if early enough) for unusual conversions, this requires your back to be to the corner though. Auto Jump Install's on FRC allowing you to airdash after. 6P bait. Don't do it fullscreen or you're going to die.

These properties, combined with the disgusting damage on clean hit makes it a strong tool which can function both defensively and offensively. The unconventional input can be tricky to learn on certain controllers, but is worth mastering. Number of hits changes depending on how many directions/buttons are pressed during the move. Cannot be RC'd if the current hit did not make contact. To use multiple hits, alternate between forward and back while mashing buttons Can combo after close-range 5H/2H, but bursts will make a mashed GV whiff when not in corner, except for Kliff's.

Cancels into FB Tyrant Rave for bigger damage with only 25 meter. Leads to bigger confirms with an RC. Can frame trap (with a wide window) due to its startup. Most useful for getting Sol in from a faraway hit. Can combo afterward if the opponent is asleep and doesn't shake out of stagger.

The jump direction is character and screen-specific, and will usually require some improvisation on top of practice, as many variables such as camera position as well as your relative height will influence the launch.
