She starts in Normal Mode (NM), in which she has neither great damage nor mobility, save for DraggingGuard:Startup:Recovery:Total 28Advantage:. By landing her command throw/hitgrab BondingGuard:All(65 pixels)Startup:13(4)Recovery:30Advantage:-32, or spending resources to perform InjectingGuard:Startup:Recovery:Total 38Advantage:,  she enters Moroha Mode (lit. Double-Edge Mode). While in Moroha, A.B.A gains a massive increase in the damage of her attacks, her overall speed, her pressure and ability to crank the guard bar, as well as several other bonuses that force the opponent to think twice about disrespecting her. Most notably, Moroha Mode gives A.B.A access to the best install super of the game, AltercationGuard:MidStartup:15+2Recovery:13Advantage:+5, allowing her to get into Goku Moroha Mode. With incredible running speed, two airdashes, and a full suite of jump-cancellable normals, Goku Moroha allows A.B.A to blitz her opponent to death before they can even blink. This comes at a cost, however. In Moroha and Goku Moroha mode, A.B.A's attacks will drain her own health whenever make contact with an opponent, whether that's a hit or block. She also has an active meter which will slowly drain towards empty, and will lose about 30% every time she is knocked down and goes into a wakeup animation. When the meter empties, she forcefully reverts back into NM with Suka MotionGuard:Startup:Recovery:Total 52Advantage:, a lengthy stance that makes her susceptible to eating a full combo or getting Instant Killed, more than any other character. She can avoid this vulnerability and regain some of her self-inflicted damage by exiting MM/GM manually via landing another keygrab, consuming a bloodpack, or entering GM. With these many options and resources, ABA can be fairly obtuse to learn, and despite her relatively low execution barrier, resource management is key to her gameplan so that her true risk/reward potentials can shine. A.B.A is best for players who love to balance risk against reward. Learn to love her double-edged playstyle. Damage Received Mod x0.89 Guts Rating 0/5 Gravity Mod x0.98 Stun Resistance 80 Prejump 4F Backdash 17F (1~8F Strike Invuln) Forwards Dash 22F Wakeup Timing 66F (Face Up)/ 52F (Face Down) Number of Jumps: 2 Number of Air Dashes: 1 Unique Movement Options Unable to Run Fastest Attack - Reversals -        A.B.A puts a strong emphasis on risk/reward by managing her slow, yet versatile, "Normal" Mode and her two incredibly oppressive, but life draining, "Moroha" and "Goku Moroha" Modes. Pros Cons   Strong Anti-airs: A.B.A has access to powerful anti-airs in all 3 forms that can all lead to great damage, corner carry and knockdowns on hit, as well as cover a variety of aerial approach options that can force opponents to approach more carefully or simply stay grounded Deceptive Tangibility: A.B.A's hurtboxes are infamously weird, with many characters struggling to properly hit her. Combined with her super heavyweight nature, this can make A.B.A weirdly hard to combo. Burst Mobility: Normal Mode has slow walk speed, but gives A.B.A access to the extremely low profile DraggingGuard:Startup:Recovery:Total 28Advantage: to duck under things in neutral. Moroha and Goku Moroha, on the other hand, have best-in-class movement. Multiple airdashes, jump-cancellable normals, and one of the fastest runspeeds in the game all give Moroha A.B.A extreme threat in neutral. Great Installs: Normal Moroha mode gives ABA high mobility, oppressive pressure, decent mixups, strong pokes and great damage, not to mention access to Danzai and GM. On top of that, her Install super, Goku Moroha, is one of the best supers in the entire game, with even the activation itself being an oppressive attack, alongside the massive boost in offensive capabilities and life refill it leaves you with. Tanky: Despite her health drain mechanic in her installs, A.B.A's high defense modifier and stun resist allows her to survive longer than average. Additionally her ability to self heal when exiting Moroha with BloodpackGuard:Startup:Recovery:Total 40Advantage:, KeygrabGuard:All(65 pixels)Startup:13(4)Recovery:30Advantage:-32, or when activating Goku MorohaGuard:MidStartup:15+2Recovery:13Advantage:+5 can help to alleviate much of the health lost during her installs. Snowball Potential: Even in Normal Mode FB DraggingGuard:Startup:Recovery:Total 26Advantage: allows her to escape almost any offense and turn the tables. During installs she gains extremely oppressive frame-trap based offense which leads into very damaging and hard to burst combos. Normal Mode: ABA begins every round in Normal Mode, which has somewhat awkward normals, as well as generally poor and committal mobility. ABA often needs to RPS at the start of every round in order to gain access to her stronger tools in Moroha mode Health drain: During both Moroha and Goku Moroha, ABA will constantly take self inflicted damage as she hits the opponent, which can only be healed back by using Bloodpacks, Keygrab or Goku Moroha. Poor management of her health can often lead to sudden deaths by abare Limited Unique Resource: ABA uses her bloodpacks to enter and exit Moroha Mode safely, as well as to enter Goku Moroha, and mismanagement of these can leave her stuck in Normal Mode, or in a disadvantageous position in Moroha Mode with no means of safely escaping it Knockdown Vulnerability: If ABA exits Moroha Mode without using her command grab or spending a blood bag, she'll enter a very long animation called Suka Motion. This leaves her vulnerable long enough that she can be punished with big combos or even certain IKs. Unique Mechanics Mode Switch  Mode Switch A.B.A starts every round in her Normal mode. A.B.A can switch to her Moroha mode by either successfully hitting the opponent with Bonding (keygrab) or by using Injecting (bloodpack). While in Moroha mode, all of A.B.A's normals (notably S and H) and specials are significantly changed for the better, but she must manage a constantly depleting unique meter, and she will inflict self damage upon hitting the opponent or making them block. Also, with 50 meter, A.B.A also has access to a heavily-improved version of this mode called Goku Moroha mode. Blood Packs  Blood Packs  A.B.A starts each round with a limited resource known as Blood Packs. Blood packs can be used as a supplement to her Moroha/Goku Moroha mode and allow her to manually enter/exit said modes in neutral. Starter Guide   Starter Guide Need help getting started?

Its speed also helps ABA convert falling j.H at any height into 2D > keygrab. On block, however, this is where the move really shines, as you have the option to mix them up with a proximity throw keygrab or with a frame trap, using either 5K, 2D or 6H, to prevent jump-outs.

On hit, you can combo into keygrab or rekkas > bloodpack to enter MM. On block, thanks to its great pushback, you can cancel into bloodpack or whiff cancel 2D to reset back to neutral.

Land a counter, bloodpack or keygrab, land half a BnB, and watch them get dizzy. Since it hits at a slightly upwards angle, it makes for an OK preemptive AA and tags opponents out of airdashes.

As it can launch grounded opponents with fairly generous untechable frames, you use this to convert stray IAD strings (i.e. IAD j.S j.P j.K) into a short air combo ending with keygrab.

Damage Guard Startup Active Recovery On-Block Invuln   28 High/Air 15 Until landing 0      One of the defining features of ABA's Normal mode. Shrinks her hurtbox down and stays active until landing. Certainly a good jump-in, with which you can also do crossups, though do note its small hitbox. Generally safe enough on standing block that you can cancel it to 5P to extend your pressure. If IB'd though, you can be punished by DPs or throws, though you can gamble with keygrab as a frametrap. High risk - high reward.

However, it's usually a much better use of meter if you can IB > FB slide (see below) their pressure/oki, especially when your back is against the corner. On regular hit, you can keygrab out of the knockdown. Oddly enough, this is not possible on CH.

Works great as a knockdown tool in case 2D > keygrab isn't possible. At midscreen, you should always go for the full rekkas to get enough frame advantage to use bloodpack, or FRC the last one for the keygrab. It's unsafe, but its long range and decent pushback can make it a bit safer. Otherwise, it's a rather slow poke that shouldn't be thrown around in neutral recklessly.

Plays an important part in the standard Normal to Moroha Mode BnB, which is [xx > 1st rekka > 2nd rekka > 3rd rekka FRC > dash > filler > keygrab]. In the corner, provided ABA's close enough to the opponent, you can do continue the combo meterlessly by linking with c.S/f.S/2S > keygrab, or 2K c.S > keygrab (on mids/heavies only), though both of this are rather tight. The frame trap between 2nd and 3rd rekka has a gap, so it is highly gimmicky and is generally unsafe, especially on block, so avoid overusing this.

This move acts as both a command throw and a strike. If from anywhere from frames 4-9, the opponent is in a throwable state and the move is in range, it will grab them. Afterwards, it will turn into a strike for the remainder of its active frames, meaning that the move can also be combo'd into. If the strike is blocked, however, it becomes very unsafe.

Being an evasive slide, A.B.A. becomes very low-profile when executing this move, making it great for sliding under projectiles or anticipated pokes for a throw > Keygrab. You can even slide under stuff like 2Ps or Robo-Ky’s knee bazooka! Just beware of lows/being thrown before the slide is over. Has an FRC point just as A.B.A. tucks herself inward, which can be used as a last resort to cancel the slide if baited, or to bait your opponent into attempting a punish.

If you have 25%, you can FRC just as the projectile appears and Bloodpack for an almost entirely safe transformation back into Moroha.

Just like regular slide, except it's entirely invincible for its full duration, and thus completely unpunishable except against those who throw on the first frame it ends. It will evade oki, including meaty setups. It will slide through moves and supers, even stuff like Raou’s Bellows Malice, for easy Keygrabs. It has a huge FRC point, which is highly useful in certain situations since you can FRC to choose which side of the opponent A.B.A will appear on, or to buffer into a surprise Keygrab. A 25% "reversal" option never looked so good. Doesn't work out of dash normally, but can be done with a Negative Edge D held during dash startup then let go during it's cancel frames, giving you stronger control of positioning in situations such as going through Justice N.B. sets from further away and Testament Zeinest/HITOMI setups designed to catch normal FB Dragging distance.

Better for damage if you can actually land a kill combo in normal mode, or delay the followup hits into a frametrap. It also has FRC points on every hit, in case you want to extend into pressure or make it safe. Note that the 2nd followup of this super has much less untechable frames, so you might want to end it after the 1st one for an easy keygrab. It's probably best to cancel into the followup hit this most of the time since it'll push the opponent back and make the move safer despite being -26.

On crouching opponents, you can also combo this into 6H for optimal damage and meter gain.

An excellent pressure tool that is somehow 0 on block.

Being slightly airborne before going active means ABA is throw-invuln during this window, so you can use this as a nice meaty button.

Slightly slower in comparison to NM j.S, but has much better range, damage, and attack level. Crucial for her fuzzy high/low mixups. Your standard setup for fuzzies is [j.S > dj.S > falling j.H > land] into more combos. These lead to BIG damage, upwards of 300+ depending on guard bar and available tension. Since it combos to j.P or j.K, you can fuzzy guard by doing  [j.S > j.K] or [j.S > j.P]. The latter isn't as useful since the hitstun on j.P is subpar, but the reward from j.S > j.K is superb. Knock an opponent down in the corner do [running j.S > j.K > dj.S > j.H]. Done properly, this is airtight, and if the opponent blocks low at any point, they're getting fuzzied.

The built-in OS with airthrow doesn't do your opponents any favors either, so don't hesitate throwing this out in neutral. On CH, you can easily confirm it into a short KD combo or ludicrous damage, despite its prorate. On normal hit/block from IAD height, you can link it to 5P, which easily leads to your ground strings.

If the move initially lands as a throw, ABA can follow up with another keygrab, meaning that going into a raw throw keygrab will let you OTG another and go right back into Moroha mode if you were in it to start with. This allows you to refresh Moroha mode with double keygrabs via 2nd rekka stagger [xxx > 2nd rekka > keygrab x2]. However, this double pickup doesn't work if the first lands as a strike (except on ABA herself), but she can instead do some combos that lead into Bloodpack FRC > keygrab.

Just be sure to keep the following in mind: it only absorbs one hit, so multi-hitters or fast attacks will beat it. This move also loses to supers, and gets punished by the gap inbetween the hits, if the opponent blocks the first one. Some characters also have char-specific ways to deal with Danzai as well, so keep in mind to not overuse it. Additionally, the armor won't keep you alive if you're already near death. As Danzai is a special move, it is also cancellable to GM activation (with 50 meter), making it a particularly dangerous offensive option.

A slow but rather far-reaching air special, you should use this move preemptively in neutral to deter the opponent from being too mash-happy during air-to-air situations. Since this move creates projectiles, they’ll linger and sometimes trade (usually with the rear orb) when you get hit first. On CH, you usually get a short air combo or a short ground one ending with butt. You can also use this move low to the ground as a meaty to bait wake-up throw attempts. Moreover, it's possible for both orbs to touch the opponent on oki situations, which will hurt a LOT on hit, though this is usually not reversal safe. Has an FRC point to remain safe, though, just as A.B.A. begins to tuck her outstretched leg back in, right when the orbs become active. Dash jump at downed opponent > orbs (FRC) on top of them > 2K, 5D, etc. to begin pressure. Where this move shines the most is as a crucial component of several of A.B.A's combos. Due to the fact that it has a uniquely high amount of air untech time while launching the opponent up, A.B.A is allowed enough time to land and continue the combo in several situations, even moreso with the FRC. Because they are projectiles, performing the move on top of the opponent can allow both to hit the opponent at the same time, dealing massive damage and giving increased untech time.

You can cancel into this super from anything grounded (normals/specials, except EngorgementGuard:MidStartup:21Recovery:14Advantage:-6), rendering Moroha ABA a constant threat whenever she has 50 meter. In this state, ABA gains a tremendous speed boost for both her movement and her attacks, double airdash, jump cancels for most of her normals, extra FRC points for many of her specials along with wider FRC windows, and extra properties for some of her moves. But most importantly, her gatling limitations are removed, as she can now cancel any normal into anything, as well as reverse cancel them (i.e. 6P > 5H > 6P > 5H > etc). Let them know fear.

Since it combos to j.P or j.K, you can fuzzy guard by doing  [j.S > j.K] or [j.S > j.P]. The latter isn't as useful since the hitstun on j.P is subpar, but the reward from j.S > j.K is superb.

You'll want to go into this when comboing to end it, but specifically when your Moroha meter is close to empty: generally better to play it safe than sorry. If the move initially lands as a throw, ABA can follow up with another keygrab, meaning that going into a raw throw keygrab will let you OTG another and go right back into Moroha mode if you were in it to start with. This allows you to refresh Moroha mode with double keygrabs via 2nd rekka stagger [xxx > 2nd rekka > keygrab x2]. However, this double pickup doesn't work if the first lands as a strike (except on ABA herself), but she can instead do some combos that lead into Bloodpack FRC > keygrab.

A slow but rather far-reaching air special, you should use this move preemptively in neutral to deter the opponent from being too mash-happy during air-to-air situations. Since this move creates projectiles, they’ll linger and sometimes trade (usually with the rear orb) when you get hit first. On CH, you usually get a short air combo or a short ground one ending with butt. You can also use this move low to the ground as a meaty to bait wake-up throw attempts. Moreover, it's possible for both orbs to touch the opponent on oki situations, which will hurt a LOT on hit, though this is usually not reversal safe.
