His main style is to use his arsenal of quick, safe attacks to pressure his opponent at close range, forcing decisions from disadvantageous situations, then reading their next move and punishing them for it. Smart management of his Charge system is key to implementing this strategy with maximum efficacy. Once in, Order Sol's pressure is nearly limitless. Despite having very short range, nearly every string can be made safe or plus on block thanks to Charge Cancelling. Getting in can be tricky, but there are ways to manage. While Order-Sol's relatively far range pokes can be easy to counterpoke, his high speed and great mobility allow him to move around projectiles or pokes. Order-Sol also has a very unconventional grounded anti-air game. Due to his 6P not being a great anti-air, you can use other tools like his blazing fast 4f j.P and Air-Throw (aided by your low jump arc) as your general purpose Anti-Airs, or Gunblaze to help cover vertical approaches. As well, 5H can cover common IAD approach angles, and higher levels of Gunblaze can cover large parts of the air by themselves. Furthermore, you can use Order Sol's various low profile moves to evade air approaches using Gunblaze, 2D, or even his low run animation. Lastly, Order-Sol's strength is reliant on good use of his Charge Meter. You must learn to keep it full by finding moments to charge using Action Charge FRC during pressure or at the end of combos, and Recharge Routes are critical to unlocking his true strength. Staying on top of your resources is key to maximizing his gameplan. Overall, Order-Sol is a great, momentum-oriented, offensive monster, with a good amount of resource management involved.

Pros Cons   Powerful in Close Range: Strong close range offense and pressure with a majority of moves being safe or plus on block, much like his present-self. Offensive Monster: Good mixups with unique cross-ups and okizeme, with his uniquely-low-jump arc providing easy-aggressive jump-ins and fuzzy guard setups and his fast running speed (faster than present-Sol) making him hard to keep out. Strong Damage Potential: High damage with charge and/or off of a counter hit, and can use Charge Keep to further cement his offensive gameplan in general. Limited ranged and anti-air conversion: Much like present-Sol, has poor range with stubby hitboxes; certain moves have awkward frame data on top of it. Is lacking somewhat in grounded anti-air game. Struggles Against Zoning: Struggles to get into range without Charge, meter or taking risks. Heavily resource reliant: Low damage without resources, and requires proper resource management to play effectively. Unique Mechanics Charge  Order Sol's specials and overdrives change properties based on the level of his Charge Gauge, a mechanic carried directly over from Guilty Gear 1. HOS's Charge Gauge can be increased multiple ways. He can use his Charge special move to increase the frame advantage on his normals, and he can also use charge keep to use the lowest level versions of his moves at any time given the necessary situations by pressing the D button at the same time you perform the move (or by holding the D button prior to the input). This is specially important in order to maintain pressure and advantage without wasting charge, or possibly gaining more by mixing the technique with Action Charge FRC. To charge keep Blockhead Buster for example, the input would be 236D~P. All of Order Sol's specials become stronger at higher levels. Each gains more hits, as well as added effects such as knocking down, extending combos, and doing more damage as well as becoming safer. Some excellent examples of his level 3 specials' bonuses include becoming jump cancellable, extremely advantageous, or just far more damaging. Upon use, his Charge Gauge drains slowly, letting Order Sol use multiple moves of the same level mid string and leading to an extensively creative combo game. Furthermore, because of how fast charge animation is, it can be used to cut recovery from his moves. This improves his frame advantage at makes him even better at sticking to opponent.

Best for interrupts, clutch punishes, and poking out when near point blank. Frame traps when done repeatedly as it's even on block. Has a subpar hitbox for a 3F normal, but still gets the job done. Can perform the usual pressure duties. Won't scale as hard as 5P if you get a hit. If done from outside of point blank range, it can have a slight frame advantage.

Huge hitstun/untechable time on (air) CH. Converts into full Dustloop after being Charge Cancelled. Relatively slow; for anti-airing on prediction or putting a big stop sign in the way. Highly advantageous when Charge Cancelled. Moves Order Sol's sprite forward immediately. This can cause some moves to whiff through him in visually bizarre ways (eg Danzai second hit).

Unusually slow 6P which is used for frame traps, oki, and for nullifying a single hit of projectiles. Staggers on hit and recovers very quickly for links. Works on oki well as it will clash with many reversals when properly spaced. Creates a slight frame advantage on block, useful in some pressure resets. Has no hitstop, as it behaves as a projectile. Bad for Anti-Air, due to its long startup and relatively low hitbox. Slightly increased stagger on CH, but HOS will generally still need resources to convert to bigger things.

Mostly used at the end of air combos post Lvl 2 Blockhead Buster. HOS is at risk due to how far this move extends his hurtbox forward while remaining in CH state throughout. But on the flipside, it's far faster on recovery and a bit less committal due to the single hit.

Lvl 2 is a larger and overall more useful version. +14 on block and three hits for better pressure. Goes up to +20 when AC FRC'd. Can perform Lvl 2 on block consecutively when charge is high enough due to the slow charge drain rate. Scores a knockdown and blowback on hit. Wallsticks when near the corner for air combo conversions (even when Action Charged in the corner). A staple in HOS's corner combos, and this change is the sole reason Recharges are now more accesible. Use Lvl 3 for an enormous burst of pressure extension. +37 on block.

Very low profile, works well point blank and as an anti-air. However, it loses to many lows and throws when mistimed. The low-profile, high vertical reach, and forward movement can be use as a counter against 'hopping' moves when reacted quickly enough (e.g. Sol Badguy's Bandt BringerGuard:High/AirStartup:32Recovery:9+4 after landingAdvantage:+1 or  Anji Mito's KaiGuard:High/AirStartup:32Recovery:8 after landingAdvantage:+1 Crosses up the opponent when HOS passes a certain point. Becomes a serious threat on oki when the opponent is low on health, due to FD negating crossup protection. Combos midscreen without AC and/or FRC. Full, big damage combos on counter hit due to being untechable, as well as closer to the corner. Sometimes works on oki setups by a far hit 2D to double GB, or late GB FRC > immediate GB again for trickier setups. Note: Cannot be charged kept with 214S+D. D must already be held before the 214S due to input priority, or you'll get Manual Charge or Burst. Kara cancelling 2D > 214S allows the move to be charged kept. This is important to keep in mind, as GB is one of the most important moves to use Charge Keep with. Lvl 2 slides farther and drops two pillars instead of one with a bit more distance, thus there's less likelihood of whiffing. Crosses up more easily than Lvl 1 due to travel speed. However, less effective as an Anti-Air. Stick to Lvl 1 for that. Vacuums on contact, changing your followup options from Lvl 1. Easier to follow up on hit, though the resulting combo will generally be different. Still combos after a bare AC. Even loops into itself. Very much plus, even excessively so on FRC. Still maintains high advantage while building Charge with AC FRC. Guaranteed to go active after frame 13, trades will generally be in your favor. Sometimes scores Counter Hits even if the opponent tags you mid move. Lvl 3 is the same as Lvl 2 but with three pillars instead and further distance travelled. A lot more untechable time on the third hit, conversions even with an AC. Drags significantly farther on hit, can drag them all the way to the corner. Overall less useful than other Level 3 moves, but strong in its own right. Maintains Lvl 2's guaranteed active window on 13f.

Fairly janky reversal which can be easily meaty baited, but blows through some other, bigger moves more easily. Invincible right into startup. Action Charge Cancelable during recovery, FRC'ing will cause HOS to drop straight down quickly for feints or to FD and make yourself safer. AC puts HOS in CH state, so if you whiff this FRC or get baited, expect to be punished heavily. You can negative edge an air Storm Viper into this FRC to bait things with another reversal. RC'ing will place HOS airborne with no air movement options. Use this move wisely. Lvl 2 is slightly faster with another hit which pushes back farther and has more hitstun. Even less safe on block than Lvl 1, despite more pushback. Same invuln as Lvl 2, but knocks away farther on hit. Lvl 3 is an expensive but worthwhile reversal. Significantly faster than previous levels, only -3 on block. Untechable Floor bounce on hit for a full conversion. Has combo conversion use as well as use as a starter. Last hit ignores OTG, so it won't screw up your knockdowns on awkward hits and can still lead to conversions. AC occurs after the last hit, not helping for safety but can build meter and still convert on AC FRC. Has a large window from the third to fourth hit, and can be intercepted between them. Air Lvl 1 wins the air to air war if they're pressing buttons  Fully invulnerable unlike most other aerial DPs, but only invul until the first frame of the actives. Frame 8 unlike the slow ground version. Mostly used to tack on top of the screen damage, or when negative edged out of a blocked ground Storm Viper AC FRC. While you can AC the DP without FRCing it, you must be careful when you do this. Most chars can punish this, ON HIT, if you're DPing them into the corner, and some others can still do this even if you hit it midscreen. Use this as a knowledge check, if they're not punishing you, why stop? Despite this, it's still a gamble for relatively low reward. Air Lvl 2 is slightly better than air Lvl 1. Same startup speed, but invul lasts longer into the active window. Untechable when done low enough to the ground. Can pick up from this from longer conversions out of lower air combos in the corner. BRP is preferred at this level to end air combos for knockdown, unless this will kill, will lead to another SV, or BRP Lvl 2 won't connect. Air Lvl 3 is useful but pricey extension similar to grounded Lvl 3. Especially good off of short air-to-air confirms. Preferred over BRP if you have this much charge and are at moderate height. Won't knock down itself, but resulting combos will still lead to it with enough charge.

Only -1 on block. Can frametrap or start pressure afterwards if the opponent doesn't know to throw. Even on standing hit, 1f plus on crouching hit, must jump/backdash/reversal to avoid being thrown. Can link to 5P or 5K on standing CH, or any 5f or faster normal on crouching CH, distance depending. Can be FRC'd right before the top of the ascent for safer air buttons or a land > throw/low mixup. This, when performed, should always be done with Charge Keep to maintain resources. Action Charging is completely unsafe unless FRC'd All versions: Foot invul for some frames on startup before going airborne. Can go over lower pokes. All versions: Will pass through opponents (even if they're standing or blocking) when used up close with the exception of FA, PO, JU, AB. Generally unpreferable. Space this. Lvl 2 is a staple combo and pressure ender. Follows the first hit with a flip kick that floorslides and knocks down. Slightly faster than Lvl 1, likelier to catch them blocking low. Second hit must be FD'd in the air, can catch people not paying attention or expecting this if you catch them airborne or upbacking. +1 on block, but can still get thrown out. Can convert when point blank with an extremely tight 5K in the corner. Sets up oki or an AC opportunity. Lvl 3 is the fastest version and leads to full conversion from anywhere due to wallbounce. Crosses HOS up in the corner, so it's generally best used midscreen. Will combo into itself with enough charge. Completely safe on block in exchange for the meter cost. Second hit is again air unblockable without FD. Very dangerous to try to upback out of. Air Lvl 1 is a short combo damage add-on. Ends air combos for a last bit of damage. No knockdown. Slightly faster than grounded Lvl 1, might be slightly safer when TK'd. Air Lvl 2 is the only guaranteed knockdown out of air combos. Scores the KD and leads to oki. Second hit is again air unblockable without FD. Okay for getting initiative in air-to-air when close enough to the ground. Air Lvl 3 has similar functionality to the grounded Lvl 3 version. Due to height and conversions, best done lower to the ground and farther from the corner. Second hit is again air unblockable without FD.

Can tag jump-outs and get HOS closer to where he wants. Used at the end of pressure strings due to being +3, but can't combo off of anything that doesn't provide as much hitstun. Helps get in, but use with caution, as it can be counter-poked/low-profiled/6P'd if used too recklessly. Starts offense or establishes pressure on contact. FRC'ing an Action Charge will grant you even more plus time. Floor slides on CH for bigger conversions (even combos to Fafnir). Lvl 1 is generally preferred for use at neutral, as it's unpunishable at no resource cost in spite of not comboing from much. Lvl 2 comes with a second knockdown attack after the first hit. Significantly quicker on startup which allows it to be converted into far easier. Predominantly for long ranged confirms into knockdown, putting HOS in his prime space and setting up for oki or Action Charge if it connects. Still works as a blockstring ender as it's faster than Lvl 1 and +4 (though eagle-eyed players will make the second hit punishable with an IB or SB). Checks advancing opponents better than Lvl 1 and gives HOS the knockdowns he needs even as a poke or whiff punish. Action Charge will still give time for meatying with lower level buttons. Lvl 3 adds a third strike that launches on hit and is jump cancelable on the third hit. Leads to full air conversions on hit. HOS's main corner conversion tool at Level 3. Can be pseudo Charge-Cancelled by jump cancelling the last hit and immediately doing 214 before going airborne. Leads to stronger followups. Leads to things like CC > Dustloop, or TK'd Lvl 3 Storm Viper in the corner. Works with TK'd Lvl 3 Bandit Revolver midscreen. Still converts after an Action Charge. Minus on block unlike the other two versions, but the jump cancel mitigates this during pressure.

Gains frame advantage across the board, cementing HOS's position as the close-range king. Raises HOS's Charge Gauge on use. Build speed gradually increases the longer it is held. As charge increases, HOS gains access to stronger versions of every special move and overdrive. Mainly used for Charge Cancelling, which replaces the recovery of any normal to 13f or however much you want to hold it for. This results in some moves gaining much higher frame advantage and letting HOS be plus on nearly any blockstring. Opponents can be made very afraid of pressing buttons.

Lets HOS build charge at the end of combos/setups with special moves, but usually sacrifices time to oki. Has an FRC on it to make this safe and sometimes gain advantage. Don't use this carelessly, as it puts HOS in Counter Hit state. Generally best used after Level 2 attacks which knock down (BRP, RI). The Air version is similar to the grounded version but locks HOS out of acting until landing. Builds the same amount of bar, best used after landing air specials which knock down. Keeps HOS in Counter Hit state all the way down, putting him in a very dangerous position when not FRC'd. Strong with Storm Viper, as it will make it safe if you hold the buttons to FD after an FRC. You can also negative edge another Storm Viper into it. Note that this puts HOS in Counter Hit state during AC's startup, so you can still be punished before an FRC is possible.

Knocks down on hit for 70 damage, or converts to around 200 damage out of simple IAD confirms, without resources. Floats higher on CH, leading to Dustloops and even higher damage. Can't be cancelled into, so Fafnir will commonly see use in neutral, or after a short charge cancel. Loses to standing pokes if improperly spaced, and will get reversal'd if used predictably.

Very long startup, especially post flash. Easy to react to. Can be counter reversal'd, but will sometimes clash due to the lengthy invincibility. First hit has a weird quirk where it can hit both the opponent and their puppet instead of just the latter Keep 5K or Storm Viper primed in case of a clash. Lvl 2 has far more utility due to free followups afterwards. Wallbounces from anywhere for a free conversion. Slightly faster than Lvl 1 with some more invuln. Best used early in combos due to how Overdrives scale damage. Still not a very good reversal. Comes with the same problems as Lvl 1. Lvl 3 is a very expensive tool with far more damage. Slightly more utility as a reversal as invuln carries somewhat into the startup of the second hit. Bigger damage and knockdown on the last hit. Pushes out farther on block, might be harder to punish for some characters. Generally not worth the resources unless it will kill.

Frame 0 after the flash; the opponent is stuck in, and must face the consequences of whatever state they were in before the super flash. Catches players pressing buttons, throwing projectiles, or even just walking/running forward. Hits from over half the screen away. Eats through other projectiles. High chip damage.

Costs FULL resources: Level 3 bar, 100 tension. Deals 40-50% of a character's life bar raw when at full health. Combos from nearly any Lvl 3 special (assuming you had enough charge on the hit to ensure HOS is still at level 3 afterwards) Restands and removes OTG on the second hit, so it works out of sweeps, corner throws, and launches.

Rarely used at higher level play due to the cost, but unburstable, and can be confirmed from fairly easily if a kill is guaranteed.
