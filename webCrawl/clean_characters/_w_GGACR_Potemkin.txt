Pot essentially is a walking tank, dealing damage of ridiculous proportions whenever he gets in with his command throw of terrifying power: The Potemkin Buster. Potemkin of course works best directly in the opponent's face, but still has some unique tools for dealing with situations outside of grab range. He has large hitboxes, good range, moves with super armor, and a variety of powerful throws at his disposal. He also has a number of anti-zoning tools, like F.D.B (a flick that turns enemy projectiles back at them) and Slide Head (full screen unblockable that sweeps anyone standing on the floor). Pot can then capitalize off these reads by using the mighty Hammer Fall to dash across the screen and begin his close-range brawling. If Pot can get you to sit still long enough, he'll throw in a Potemkin Buster and laugh as 1/3rd of your health is ripped away in a single move. Perhaps more than any other character, Pot is capable of punishing on good reads very well. He has the best ground throw range in the game without Pot Buster alone, along with two anti-air grabs, an aerial command throw and the best air throw range in the game to boot. It's important to know that even with all of his anti-zoning tools, Potemkin still traditionally struggles against zoners and those who stay out of his range. As well, his mobility is awful, with no airdash to speak of. Though he may have trouble against good zoning and projectiles galore, big damage is Pot's game. He just needs to get close enough to readily instill the fear.

Pros Cons   Potemkin Buster: The grab that defined every future anime grappler. No move matches its speed, damage, and range. Its sheer existence instills dread in every choice the opponent makes, including defending. Hammerfall: Sees obvious use as an armored charging move to challenge pokes, but the real meat comes from its application in Hammerfall Break Pressure—a way to gain frame advantage and correct spacing. Hits Like A Freight Train: Normals have ginormous base damage, reach and active time. Potemkin easily deals over 50% from several starters. Chokeholds His Opponent: Gets great knockdowns off of everything, turning his opponent's defense into paste in a matter of seconds. Defensive Buster: Toolkit lends itself excellently to universal defensive options like Instant Block, Slashback and Backdash. His throws also have great range and reward. Pressuring Potemkin is quite scary! Built Like A Tank: Has the highest defense and stun modifier in the game. Horrid Mobility: Cannot dash or airdash, limiting his options to simply walking forward. Hammerfall is not a suitable replacement for either of these, and as such neutral requires strong patience and decision-making. Runaway Matchups: Potemkin's awful movement is accentuated when opponents don't need to come to him to be effective. He struggles against foes who gain advantage from running away and laming him out. Big: Susceptible to F-ShikiSometimes known as "Fuzzy Overhead". When you are in blockstun, you can switch high/low blocking, but your blocking animation and hurtbox does not change until you leave blockstun or block another attack. F-Shikis take advantage of this and use overheads that would miss on crouching characters, but not on standing characters.s, instant overheads, and specific combos.

Tied with 2K for Potemkin's quickest low. Although 2K has more range, 5K has a higher attack level and will combo into 2S, giving it much more explosive damage.

It's quick, the hitbox is large and being jump-cancellable with Level 3 hitstun gives it a lot of use in aerial combos. The issue is nothing more than it being a close proximity button. His other options at close range help Potemkin in far more areas or have layered applications, which vastly outstrip this move's potential. Often just blockstring or combo filler, but it'll do its job without complaints.

Hits at an upward angle, so you can throw it out early to stop your opponent from going airborne. If you hit an airborne opponent at range, cancel into (2S) Heat Knuckle, or Heavenly Potemkin Buster if you've got tension to spare/it will win the round.

Works like f.S, but for opponents that'll stay grounded or very low in the air (I-no, Order Sol, Jam to an extent). Cancel into Hammerfall Break for better advantage on block or just to gain ground, or cancel into Slide Head for cheap (but very punishable) mixup. CH 5H leads to Slidehead or Hammerfall Break into a follow up combo. 5H is also the only move besides 6P/2H that leads to Giganter super vs airborne opponents. At distances where nothing else is possible, Air CH 5H > delay 5H works.

While easier to use than 6K, the atrocious startup renders it very reactable. Best used as a surprise tactic after spacing the opponent out where they wouldn't expect to be hit overhead. Anti-Air CH can be followed up (situationally) for a combo into Heat Knuckle/HPB.

Sports a great hitbox, lots of upper-body invincibility and lots of active frames. Pray the jump-ins away. 6P beats a ton of air attacks that other characters might struggle with, and it's so low profile that many attacks will whiff even if Potemkin anti-airs far too late. It's a solid defensive option against many things, such as late IADs, certain long-ranged pokes or improper safejumps. Whiffs on crouchers and has a vertical hitbox, so it nearly entirely lacks offensive use, but it does plenty already. Followups are simple and damaging with many branching options. On a normal hit, Potemkin can go for an easy knockdown with Heat Knuckle or better yet jump cancel for an air combo. Options naturally become more freeform with a counterhit. See the  combo page for more specifics. FRC Window Proration Guard Bar+ Guard Bar- Level   N/A 90% 14 6 4   Floats on CH (untechable for 42F)  6K  Tabber requires Javascript to function.

Terrifying mixup tool combined with 5K. Only used during oki situations for three reasons. One, no buttons gatling into 6K. Two, no opponent would ever just sit there and let Potemkin stagger into an overhead at close range, as they're too busy screaming bloody murder. Three, if you find an opponent who is willing to just sit there, you already know what to doGuard:176 pixelsStartup:3Recovery:37Advantage:. Spacing Potemkin out or safejumping is the preferred way to enforce the aforementioned mixup. While 6K has throw invulnerability on startup, it ends 3 frames before the attack hits. For this reason, its usage as a point-blank meaty will lose to reversal throws. Timing the attack late will allow it to shrug through throw attempts, but then it won't catch most characters' jump startup, among other problems. Although one of Potemkin's hardest combos due to charging, 6K -> Hammerfall combos on crouching and baits bursts automatically. It's only really worth it with meter, but it leads to insane damage. Without meter, cancel to 2D. Gatling Options: 2D   FRC Window Proration Guard Bar+ Guard Bar- Level   N/A 85% 15 6 5    6H  Tabber requires Javascript to function.

Great for tagging backdashes or just landing an unexpected hit at range. Ridiculous on counter hit, as the CH holds them in place momentarily, allowing followups such as Giganter. Cancel into Slide Head for an unblockable, or Hammerfall Break to get big frame advantage thanks to the custom hitstun. Characters with 4/5 frame prejump cannot escape Slide Head without IB/Backdash/Reversal. Can be FRC'd right before it becomes active. 5P > 6H FRC Pot buster for shenanigans, or let it rip to catch backdashers.

Its best use is to poke Eddie's shadow from far away at little risk to yourself. Otherwise any other normal would do you better.

Not a bad button, but not as widely applicable as 5K, and the reward on hit is rather poor. On hit (f.S  >) 2D is usually the most you will get. If the opponent is crouching, you can combo into 2S either on crouch hit or from c.S if close enough, but this rarely happens. Keep in mind that getting a knockdown as Potemkin is more than acceptable even if the damage isn't impressive, since you can easily make up for the poor damage from now afterwards.

Likely Potemkin's best normal in terms of overall usefulness. Good range, high attack level, staggers on counter-hit, but most importantly, it has a vacuum effect that pulls the enemy towards you on hit or block. Can follow up with 2H at close range for massive combos, and combined with HFBGuard:Startup:Recovery:Total 15Advantage: it's 0 on block.

Damage Guard Startup Active Recovery On-Block Invuln   66 Mid 13 5 35 -21      Total: 52 A vicious uppercut that reaches ridiculously high, starts all of Potemkin's nastiest combos. The easiest followup is Heat Knuckle, which will always work on a previously grounded opponent. Using HFB instead is where Potemkin starts his aerial routes, which all do gargantuan damage and lead into knockdowns. Counterhit 2H is Potemkin's absolute best starter. Your opponent can't tech until they've hit the ground, no matter how high they were when you hit, along with a great starting proration. Even relatively simple combos off of CH 2H can do 50% or more. Slashback 2H is a frequent way to get these counterhits and annihilate people. The move also carries a 1.25x dizzy modifier, so use this instead of 6H if you're aiming to stun. It's not recommended as an anti-air over 6P, but if you're going to use it then make sure you know it'll connect before committing to it. With no invincibility and slow startup, you'll have to throw it out early, but it can at least catch crossups quite well. Has an FRC point when it goes active, but it's mostly situational, used for some anti-burst option selects and some specific/stylish combos.

Silly air normal with many uses, but shouldn't be relied upon. Catching an air opponent plummets them to the earth with you for a knockdown. Can change the angle of descent by holding left/right, and has lower body invuln. While useful for many things; getting to the ground faster, whiffing it for surprise busters, and as an anti-anti-air, j.D is also very gimmicky. Potemkin should rarely ever be in the air, and there are plenty of moves that beat it clean or will cause a clash, which you'll lose if you're not prepared. Don't throw it out willy-nilly.

Scores a knockdown on hit, which is always great for Potemkin. Fantastic as a counterpoke, especially when mixed in with your own pokes and Hammerfall, and can be quite abusable in certain matchups. However in terms of raw data, it's inferior to Reverse in every way. Oddly only Level 2 on block. Has some interesting FRCs. The first FRC point is before the hit, turning the move into a weird command jump that can be jump installed for air options. The second FRC point is during the first active frames making it safer if blocked. Mega Fist Backward (214P) is solid as an easy-to-input defensive option, and can be mixed in with other options to make it harder to handle Potemkin's defense. Better as a raw attack than Forward thanks to superior data, it has a high attack level, more active frames, less recovery, and staggers on counter hit for big damage. But don't lie, you got this as a Potemkin Buster misinput and wrote it off as a disengagement option. Can be FRC'd on frames 25-26F, and 28-29F. Yes, they're a frame apart. No, I don't know why.

Slide Head has two different attacks during its active frames. If either hit, the opponent gets knocked down and kept them there for an extra 40 frames over normal knockdown length, giving Pot time to advance. The first is Potemkin's actual body itself, a level 5 attack that hits low, but that's likely not what you're using it for. If the first attack misses, the second attack occurs, which sends out an unblockable shockwave, covering about 3/4 of the ground at full zoom-out. This shockwave can be avoided by being airborne or if a character lifts their hurtbox off the ground (Dizzy dash, May 5K, etc.). As a fullscreen tool, it can make characters like A.B.A or Justice think twice about using certain tools in neutral, as a well timed Slide Head will put them right into your vicious oki game. Beware, if you use it poorly or your opponent reads you, you can be punished severely. Has a secondary use in oki. It has a very similar animation to 6K, but as previously stated the first hit is a low while the move will instead become unblockable if spaced and requires a completely different response. This is generally only worth it along with the FRC, but makes blocking all the harder.

Deals huge damage, and causes a knockdown when it connects on a grounded opponent. The armor and speed of Hammerfall makes it amazing for crushing opponents who try to keep Potemkin away with slower buttons, and as a frametrap or anti-jump during pressure. Hammerfall's second yet most important trait is its ability to be cancelled into Hammerfall Break (or Hammerfall Brake, if you will), which can be used to dramatically reduce the recovery of many attacks and/or move Potemkin forward during his pressure. By itself Hammerfall is already fantastic, but with this it sets Potemkin apart from any other grappler. Because of its wide use, Hammerfall should be charged by holding back whenever possible, often referred to as Potemkin's ABCs. Note that Potemkin cannot cancel the first frame of Hammerfall, as he must first enter Hammerfall before he is able to cancel it. Additionally, the lack of an input buffer requires P to be input distinctly after H.  Hammerfall also has an FRC window, which begins 3F after hitstop or 3F of Potemkin's fists connecting on whiff. This FRC is one of the best in the game, as it turns Hammerfall massively plus (+14) and enables explosive combos. It is likely the most important FRC for Potemkin to learn.

Note that if you hit P too late (within about ten frames of it going active), Break won't occur, so it's worthwhile to practice at different ranges and get the timing down, especially when using it for going in after Slidehead, or to catch an opponent with a Potemkin Buster. Fastest possible Hammer Fall Break completes in 16F, 1F of Hammer Fall and 15F of Hammer Fall Break.

A mighty flick with two separate aspects: the attack and the reflect (see below). The attack portion sports a huge, disjointed hitbox extended well beyond and above the flick itself and good priority. If it hits a grounded opponent, they'll be staggered, and a counter-hit will catapult the opponent across the screen and cause a wallstick for followups if Potemkin is close enough. On block, they'll be pushed away a good distance, but it's fortunately plus on block. Can be used as a frametrap if Potemkin is spaced out and doesn't want to risk Hammerfall, but sadly gives little reward on an air hit. The second aspect of F.D.B. During frames 4-14 of F.D.B. 's startup, any projectile within Potemkin's hurtbox (the box that determines if Potemkin is hit) will be reflected back as a slow moving, screen filling projectile. After reflecting a projectile, Potemkin is strike invincible until he recovers, although this won't save you from multi-hit projectiles unless they're out of the way by then. This projectile will keep going even if it hits other projectiles (most of which will be destroyed), and will travel for a full screen length or until it strikes the opponent.

In addition to its already great range, many attacks actually bring the character's throwbox forward, making them even easier to catch before their active frames have even started.

Blast their body across the map, and build tons of meter. Midscreen, you sacrifice oki for using this, and will need to Hammerfall to regain footing. This doesn't render it useless, as sometimes the damage is just enough to close out the round, or the extra damage and meter are deemed useful enough to you that it's fine having a worse oki situation. In the corner you don't sacrifice as much, but you'll still need to Hammerfall. If they Slashbacked your Heat Knuckle, there are three things they can do from here. The first is to simply FD, and survive at the cost of meter. The second is to use air reversals, which are detailed below. The third is to Slashback Heat Extend, which will cause them to fall to the ground slowly.

Sports infinite armor, which if struck makes Potemkin enter a reeling stance and immediately attack 10 frames after hitstop ends, even autocorrecting if he's crossed up. Knocks down on hit with a good chunk of damage, and although it's not frame 1 it can blow through a lot of predictable/"flowcharty" pressure options without much effort. All this on a character who already has such strong defensive options seems like it's too good to be true. Unfortunately, Judge Gauntlet is marred by many severe issues. It's saddled with horrendous startup, a bad hitbox that's very easy to avoid by jumping, no throw invincibility, and other character-specific counters. Worst of all, the reeling stance and hitstop only serves to telegraph the move and make it easier for opponents to avoid it once it's triggered (although moves with low hitstop won't cause issues). This results in Judge being highly recommended against by many Potemkin players. If you don't know what you're doing, you shouldn't use Judge. The move's best applications come in beating very specific setups typically involving slow multi-hitting moves, as it's too lacking everywhere else. If you insist on gambling on it any way it can sometimes work, but it should never be your first option and you will likely be better off forgetting it exists.

Takes all the suck from Judge Gauntlet and turns it into goodness. Connects as part of a combo, but you can't cancel into it from air normals. You'll mostly use it as a followup to ground attacks like counter-hit 6P, a 2H followed by Hammerfall Break, or after midair jump cancels. On hit, Potemkin jumps in the opposite direction from the one he was originally traveling and busters the opponent with a slightly different knockdown arc and an FRC for even more damage. In the corner, c.S > APB and 2H > HFB > APB loops into themselves, creating the Potemkin Bus Tour which has no stops and only lets you off when you're dead. This lends itself greatly to cashing out on tension and closing rounds, since c.S connects after a ground Potemkin Buster in the corner. Actually hits mid and whiffs on grounded opponents, so it can be blocked using Faultless Defense in the air. If blocked in this manner, Potemkin can RC it.

Godlike super, and one of Potemkin's best uses for meter. On hit, Giganter staggers your opponent on the ground and floats them in the air along with a hefty 3x stun modifier to almost instantly put them in the red—especially on counterhit. If that doesn't stun, Potemkin has more than enough time to followup with whatever he wants, which can simply be a Potemkin Buster or a jaw-dropping stun combo if he so pleases. Can cancel into Gigantic Bullet from 16-29F regardless of hit or whiff, which gives Giganter even more interesting applications. Also fantastic as a reversal. The projectile always comes out and stays out even if Potemkin gets hit, absorbs projectiles, and is plus on block. Combined with the massive reward on hit, Giganter will make many opponents think twice about pressure against Potemkin. There's a deadzone between Potemkin and Giganter, and the move also lacks throw invincibility after the superflash, so it's not infallible, but this is a small price to pay for everything else. Fear the mirror. Even then, be careful as you lose invul 1 frame before giganter becomes active, so it can end up in a loss in low health scenarios.

Things only get better when you use it after an air hit Giganter, going from a simple 5K followup to netting you a 2H for even crazier routes. Note that if you're using this in the corner, Gigantic Bullet loses a lot of merit. The aforementioned wallbounce can play against you, so stick to the regular Giganter or APB there. An easy way to use this super is to simply spin your stick/pad during Giganter's superflash, then pressing P. If you're too lazy to do 6K > HF > FRC, Gigantic Bullet's got you covered.

Despite the cool name and high raw damage, HPBHeavenly Potemkin Buster is very mediocre and can end up as a waste of Tension, but hey at least it's not Judge Gauntlet. HPB in combos serves as a low execution, burst-safe ender. Everything falls apart if you're willing to put in a little more elbow grease, as 2H > HFB > APB does nearly identical damage while allowing for better followups for less meter cost. Further issues pile on, from its terrible damage scaling, high price and more. Outside of easily closing rounds, you should forget about using this move in combos. The other use for HPB is as an anti-air. Invulnerability during startup and upper-body invincibility while the hitbox is active lets it get the job done, but the initial hitbox is lackluster and whiffs at random. As you may have also guessed, launching Potemkin into the air is a massive issue when the move misses, and its unimpressive startup often means a 6P probably would've worked just fine for more than acceptable (if not better) reward. Still, you can get some uses out of it for opponents who insist on buzzing over your head, or to flex your crazy reads.
