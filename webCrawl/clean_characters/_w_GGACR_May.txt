May is a midrange "bully" character who contests space aggressively. May's gameplay is defined by her amazing normals, extremely good air mobility, and her oceanic moveset. May loves to take to the air, where her high jump height synergizes well with j.H and j.2H to make her hard to contest. Outside of her air normals, May has a number of annoying moves to demand respect, like her Dizzy-inducing 6P, Restive Rolling, and her Dolphin specials. If May ever gets a knockdown, she can enforce pressure with frametraps, command grabs, Applause for the Victim for okizeme, and ambiguous crossups. In many cases the best plan of action for her opponents is to use FD to try and push her back out, because up close she's really darn strong. May's toolset is very large and has lots of flexibility, allowing her to adapt her playstyle as she pleases. Some matchups require excellent movement rather than direct attacks to beat options and when she does hit the execution required to turn it into a damaging knockdown is very high. Managing charge can be very tricky even for high-level players, though thankfully the reward for landing a hit is often quite high. Overall, May is a character best suited for players who love aggression and high mobility.

Pros Cons   Strong Hitboxes: May has several normals with excellent hitbox/hurtbox ratios. Key ones are 5H, f.S, 2S, and j.H. Big Damage and Stun: May has highly damaging corner conversions and counterhit conversions midscreen. Her high damage normals and chargable 6P build stun very quickly. Dolphin Neutral: Horizontal DolphinGuard:AllStartup:7Recovery:8+3 after landingAdvantage:-9 is an incredible move with fantastic frame data that is very hard to contest in some matchups thanks to its speed and active frames. While nominally unsafe, May is launched back on block and can cancel the recovery on whiff, making it difficult to punish. FB Dolphins: FB Horizontal Dolphin is an essential combo tool for enabling May's higher-damaging combos and is plus on block, while Vertical Dolphin lets May zip right over projectiles. Good Mixups: May has an above average air throw range as well as Overhead KissGuard:90 pixelsStartup:24Recovery:38Advantage:, a forward moving command grab. Moves like j.2H and HVD can cross up ambiguously. Movement: May has one of the better backdashes in the game as well as one of the highest Super Jumps in the game. These attributes, combined with non-linear air movement options and strong air normals such as j.H, means that May has very strong control in the air. Lack of Knockdowns at Range: May can find it difficult to confirm far range buttons into a knockdown without meter. f.S into 3K can be your only option, if it combos at all. Anti-Air Food: May's air movement, while strong, is generally linear. Characters with good anti-airs can easily punch her out of the sky on a read, especially with her more committal options. This requires May to take a more grounded approach in certain matchups and limits the effectiveness of her most prominent strength. Highly Committal: Many of May's most important buttons are slow, and her pressure is reliant on dolphins to keep up threat. Opponents who properly space her out or throw out big active hitboxes pre-emptively can stuff some of her threat. Starter Guide   Starter Guide Need help getting started?

StartupThe time before an attack is active including the first active frame. For example, an attack with 10F startup means the attack will do nothing for 9 frames, then hit the opponent on the 10th frame. frames    ActiveThe active frames of an attack refers to the amount of time an attack can hit the opponent. Frames    InactiveFrames in the middle of multi-hit attacks which cannot hit the opponent, but are after the move has become active at least once.

Great tool for footsies. Can be used to go over Robo-Ky's slide, Anji's stomps, Potemkin's Slide Head, and other low moves. The combination of a high hitbox, decent startup, and easy gatling into c.S > 2D  make this one of May's best normals for running her gameplan. Use this to poke effectively and fish for knockdowns.

For starters it has a great disjointed hitbox, which makes good for anti-airing bad approaches. It also builds massive amounts of Stun on hit and can be used in corner combos for relaunches and bigger damage. Conditioning your opponents to fear this move is a great way to help get your gameplan started. Will Dizzy if stun is high Launches back on hit.

As a tip, you can charge Dolphin while performing this move by inputting 6P and then immediately pulling the control stick back to the 1 position. As long as P is held down, May will continue to charge the move despite the control stick no longer being in the 6 position. 6P Stun Value   Startup (Charge)  Stun Multiplier  Blockstun   25 (16) 3.000 16   26 (17) 3.375 22   27 (18) 3.438 22   28 (19) 3.500 23   29 (20) 3.500 23   30 (21) 3.563 24   31 (22) 3.625 25   32 (23) 3.625 25   33 (24) 3.688 26   34 (25) 3.750 26   35 (26) 3.750 27   36 (27) 3.813 28   37 (28) 3.875 28   38 (29) 3.875 29   39 (30) 3.938 29   40 (31) 4.000 30   41 (32) 4.000 31   42 (33) 4.063 31   43 (34) 4.125 32   44 (35) 4.125 32   45 (36) 4.188 33   46 (37) 4.250 34   47 (38) 4.250 34   Version FRC Window Proration Guard Bar+ Guard Bar- Level   6P N/A 90% 14 6 4   6[P] N/A 90% 14 6 4   6P:  Blows back opponent on hit Dizzy modifier x3 6[P]:  Blows back opponent on ground hit Attack starts up 8F after releasing button Special cancellable on frames 17~first active Custom blockstun  6H  Tabber requires Javascript to function.

If you score a CH on j.H you can often convert into this move. Stagger can let you score an Overhead Kiss if they're not paying attention, but usually you'll have to buffer a Dolphin or convert to super. At point blank it will whiff on a few characters post-stun so don't use it to start your post-stun combo on them unless you space it further away: AB(always)/MA(always)/ED(roughly half the time)  The Max Charged version can be whiff canceled   Turns into an overhead. Goes up to 90 damage. Gains over a second of hitstun on aerial counterhit. Special cancellable *before and slightly after* active frames.

Works best as either a hail-mary sweep to go under fireballs or as a guaranteed knockdown if May is too far for 2D to combo. Extreme low profile after the first 7 frames at the cost of being incredibly unsafe on block and in CH state until recovery. Must be FRC/RCed to make safe. Knocks down on hit.

Despite being -9, launches May back on contact, making good punishes difficult. Active for a good amount of time. All versions: Can have the landing recovery cancelled on whiff. Makes whiff games a nightmare to deal with if the opponent is unfamiliar. Difficult to determine when the active window ends. You can often whiff this and then immediately land and throw. Has an FRC point for being made safer on either on hit or on block. H travels further with minutely longer startup. Extremely active, far traveling move. Slides on air, a staple in May's corner BnBs.

Just as silly as the horizontal versions. Builds stun Very fast attack that becomes a high on frame 18. Quite unsafe on block, but still has an FRC to get out of dodge. Must be jump installed in block strings for jump/airdash after FRC. Will auto-JIs if not cancelled into. Staple in lame loops. Can be made safe on block or on hit with FRC. H version travels higher than the S version. Mostly used for combo enders. Can be FRC'd for high damage extensions. Similar FRC behavior to the S Version.

Used heavily in fuzzy guard setups with FRC. Can be FRC'd right before it goes active to land and throw/low instead. Used in some combos to knockdown and/or for additional damage.

Space control and pressure tool. The number of dolphins released (1-6) changes based on the duration for which the button is held. Not holding the button causes the dolphin to release at the quickest possible timing. Automatically releases two seconds after maximum charge, but releases fewer dolphins. D version can be used for certain burst bait setups into combos. Has a very short hurtbox, can be used to low profile for the first half of the move. When FRC'd gives you a jumping mixup if used as oki. Dolphins exit the hoop based on the hoop's facing direction. Air hits from the dolphins cause knockdown making it a difficult combo tool.

It has a big startup so it's easy to react to. Has 6 frames of strike invincibility right before it activates. Fully converts on a successful grab.

Unlike a lot of other characters, May builds a lot of Stun very quickly. The speed of the IK activation combined with the fast startup of the grab makes this really easy to combo into in a real match off of a Dizzy. Your opponent has to mash hard in order to escape, and even then it might not be enough unless they immediately jump. It's even fully invulnerable for almost 20 frames, so go wild. Acts as an actual reversal. Can be input as 4123641236H or 6321463214H no matter what side May is on.
