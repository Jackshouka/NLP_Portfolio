Faust controls the screen and the pace of the match primarily with his large normals and random items thrown with 236P. His pokes can be difficult to contest and his air domination, particularly with j.H and j.2K FDC, can make approaching Faust a hassle, let alone dealing with his ranged game. The items Faust tosses  change the state of the game, with effects ranging from mini moving hitboxes, items that cover air approach and deal large stun, bombs, and even food. Combined with the ability to crawl and a frustratingly tiny crouching hurtbox, Faust can be quite the pain to deal with from generally anywhere. On the flip side, Faust tends to deal limited damage with short combos (partially due to his unusual gatling tree) and has to cut things even shorter if he wants a knockdown. His defensive options, although not necessarily weak, are somewhat unconventional and will require players to learn the appropriate strategy. Overall, Faust is a very strong character whose basics can be grasped within literally minutes.

He controls the pace of most matchups, and usually has a dominating answer for most neutral situations. Even if he's airborne, the game never tilts far out of favour, due to his suite of air options and mobility. Pros Cons   Strong Zoning Game: Large buttons, several disjoints and random items make for a strong zoning game with good inevitability. Tiny Hurtbox: Fausts crouching hurtbox is extremely low to the ground, meaning he can be difficult to hit while crawling. Faust can low profile many jump-ins and pokes just by crawling out of the way. j.2K FDC: Faultless Defense Canceling j.2K allows Faust to air brake abruptly, which helps his mixups, zoning, and general movement. Threatening Mixups: j.2K by itself or FDC'd, TK Going My Way, and Hack 'n' Slash let Faust threaten frame traps, an instant overhead, and an unblockable. Strong Trio of Anti-airs: 6P, 5K, and 2K let Faust swat opponents out of the sky from almost any angle. RNGesus Giveth: Faust's item toss is heavily tilted in his favor, and his items include screen-filling meteors, various slow projectiles, and even status effects like poison or a maxed tension pulse. Large Aerial Hurtbox: Faust is famously the victim of many character-specific combos due to his large aerial hurtbox. Starter Guide   Starter Guide Need help getting started?

StartupThe time before an attack is active including the first active frame. For example, an attack with 10F startup means the attack will do nothing for 9 frames, then hit the opponent on the 10th frame. frames    ActiveThe active frames of an attack refers to the amount of time an attack can hit the opponent.

It's useful for starting block strings or mashing out of pressure, though it can whiff against crouching characters or moves with somewhat low profiles. Doesn't extend Faust's hurtbox much, so it can be used as a fast anti-air that can hit low air dashes or jump-ins. Low profiled by Millia and Zappa running and Faust crawling. Combos into c.S, f.S and 2S on normal hit. Combos into 2D on crouch/counter hit. Combos into 2H on counter hit. On block, 5P > 2D, having a 2 frame gap, and 5P > 2H (3 frame gap) act as natural frame traps.

Hits most standing characters, but completely whiffs on all crouching opponents and most dashing opponents. Incredibly active, which makes it notoriously good as a counterpoke against anything that can't low profile it. On counter hit will put the opponent in a float state allowing a followup air combo. Can also be used in combos, either to start a combo against an airborne opponent or stabilize their position from a distance and JC into air stuff. Another intrinsically good property is that, post active frames, the hurtbox only remains extended for several frames, so trying to whiff punish it from the front isn't very practical in a lot of matchups. Moves that are quick to move under it (Stun Dipper), or are entirely disjointed (Stun Edge, HCL) make for more appropriate whiff punishes. When trying to determine whether or not you can use it to anti-air, think "Can they reach my torso before 5K goes active? ", if they can, you will be stuffed. If they cannot, at worst you will trade and completely stop their approach. In the event that you manage to hit this on the ground, it will also combo into all of its gatlings except 5D, making it able to route any way you want.

Combos into EVERY one of its gatling options except 5D, including ones that reverse gatling back, allowing incredible variety in combos. Frametraps with 2H (1f gap). Be sure you are in the right range, because f.S is dangerous to use at close range. While 2K is the typically preferred meaty, c.S can give you a weighty frame advantage if you hit them on wakeup. This move is great to OS with throw on your opponent's wakeup in the corner (Dash in FD Brake > 6SH, as you can block wakeup DP, catch certain backdashes, clip late jump out attempts and throw opponents that are too defensive – all the while preserving frame advantage). Watch out for wakeup throw OS, or doing the maneuver so loosely that they can react and toss you out of it.

Comes out quickly for its range: it's 1 frame faster than c.S up close, and the longer part of the hitbox appears on frame 10. High recovery makes this move VERY dangerous to whiff, which is made worse since its hitbox can be easily low profiled - some characters can run right under it. Make sure you are not being too predictable, lest you want to be punished by a stray counterpoke and potentially eat a full combo. You never want to end pressure on f.S because it is hideously unsafe on block. Reverse gatling into 2K if you want to use this move while an item is onscreen. Combos into 5H at certain ranges or with dash momentum, which allows you to set up pogo and 2D knockdowns. Technically combos into 2K but it's not very feasible that you'll use it for that reason.

While it has slightly slower startup and a shorter hitbox compared to f.S, it's more difficult to low profile and puts the opponent in much more blockstun. Very important in combos because it has a good hitbox, and combos into both 236S and 2D.

Slower and shorter than 6H, thus it is hardly an effective overhead. It has invincibility frames during the spinning animation. Its not much, but if your opponent is using a slow or reactable poke of some sort, 5D can be used as a situational punish. 6HD option-selects throw, gold burst and 5D on wakeup. -3 on block but strike invulnerable during those frames, the ONLY way to punish this move is to IB and punish with a 3f move  FRC Window Proration Guard Bar+ Guard Bar- Level   N/A  8 20 3   Faust is in CH state during move  6P  Tabber requires Javascript to function.

Can be OS'd with throw for a decent defensive motion when under heavy fire in the corner. Doesn't have good horizontal reach and bad recovery, so interchange with Faust's other anti-airs, such as: 5K at a distance, 2K when they may end up behind your head, and preemptive options such as j.H when you have time to get it out there. Does not combo on normal hit without an Item Toss like Hammer, however on counter-hit you can cancel into Item Toss and still convert comfortably. 6P does not carry the invincibility for the full duration of the startup, so jumping attacks in their active frames that aren't deep enough to win outright will counter-hit trade on the 1st active frame. Oftentimes, Faust can still combo from this, but it does remove 6P as an anti-air option when Faust is on low life.

One of Faust's most rewarding starters, especially in the corner. While a keen opponent will be ready to block it, it can still often catch people who are too focused on blocking thrown items It makes an excellent preemptive whiff punish in pressure, as it's hurtbox is fairly receded mid-startup. Someone trying to poke out of pressure against it may find their attack whiffing just shy of Faust's torso. Extremely dangerous on whiff but can be special canceled on block to be made unpunishable (6H > item throw is -5), or into a tame frame trap with Rerere no Tsuki.

Damage Guard Startup Active Recovery On-Block Invuln   12 Low 7 2 7 +1      Total: 15 Fast, low hitting jab with good range. While it has a high proration rate, the utility is too good to pass up. Most useful for tick throws, but can low profile some enemy pokes too, and naturally good for starting pressure strings. Fully extends a hurtbox on frame 1. Combos into 2S, letting you get knockdowns or highly prorated sweep/pogo combos. 2P > 2H (5f gap on block) is a useful frame trap, especially on ranges where 2S gatling would whiff (e.g. roundstart). 2P > 2D is an even tighter frame trap (4f gap) that also challenges opponents' attempts to jump out of anticipated 2H after blocking 2P.

Thanks to having multiple hits, it can smash through armored moves like Hammerfall and beat summons like Dizzy's fish without skipping a beat. Has three hits: one hitting in an upward angle that is good for anti-airing some attacks, a second hit that goes a bit lower, and a third hit where Faust's leg is near the ground The first hit can be jump canceled, and the last 2 hits are lows. Has a fast startup, and covers a large area while putting Faust's hurtbox lower to the ground. First hit will whiff on some crouching opponents making the startup for the second hit 10 frames. An excellent meaty tool that keeps your opponent pinned in blockstun and can lead into a variety of mixups. Has a delayed cancel into 2P after third hit. Third hit will also force the opponent to crouch. While it has gatling into f.S it will not gatling into c.S and pressing button when too close will make it so nothing comes out. Keep that in mind. Frametraps with 2D (2f gap). 2K has tons of mixup, combo, and pressure opportunities rolled into one move. The first hit's jump cancel can be used in tricky FDC overhead setups, while each hit can be cancelled into 5D or 214D for slower but more rewarding overheads. Up close, any hit will combo into 5H while the third hit can give 2P and 2D confirms. Gatling Options: 2P, f.S, 5H, 5D, 2D   FRC Window Proration Guard Bar+ Guard Bar- Level   N/A 80% 6, 5×2 7×3 2   Cancellable into 2P from 17F onwards  2S  Tabber requires Javascript to function.

While not as common as Faust's other anti-airs, 2S covers similar vertical space as 6P, and is more rewarded for a hit because it can be jump cancelled into an air combo with no restrictions. Combos into all of its gatlings except 5D on normal hit, allowing for creative combos when used as a starter or go-between. 2S > 2D > 2S is a genuine combo sequence on some characters. Can be a fairly generous (if risky) abare option due to its active frames, especially if your opponent does a manual delay in a blockstring. Staggers on counter-hit. Frametraps with 2H (1f gap).

Disjointed, good damage, and can be chained into 2P/5P to reduce the recovery. 2H > 5P is +4 on normal block. Has almost no vertical hitbox, so it can be jumped or high profiled easily. As with f.S, it is often canceled into item throw, or scalpel thrust for a frame trap. Combos into scalpel thrust on crouching opponents (if they're close enough) or on counter hit. Normal hit combos into 236S or any gatling except 5D. Like many of Faust's pokes, this move is hard to whiff punish directly, but whiffing it will let them run in for free. In the Zappa and Kliff matchups, this move should be your main poke as they can often low profile f.S.

Damage Guard Startup Active Recovery On-Block Invuln   38 Low 13 3 23 -12      Total: 38 Fairly slow for a 2D, but has great range, and can be jump canceled. Because Faust's head is so huge, it can sometimes tag airborne opponents on the way up or down without even trying to. Use it to keep your opponent honest blocking low and to start a jump to continue pressure. Canceling into item throw reduces the recovery somewhat, but thanks to the long range opponents can struggle to do something against it. Important for combos because 2D > 2S will get the opponent into the air to start an air combo. Watch the range though, because being too far away from the opponent will cause the 2S to whiff or the air combo to drop.

An important element of Faust's mixup game is to do a faultless defense cancel (or Drill cancel for short, check the Faust board on Dustloop for more details) immediately off the ground to do a very fast overhead j.K. The move central to your air-combo game. Can be jump cancelled into itself, will gatling into moves that loop back to it, or straight to a combo ender. Sometimes you will tag a random hit with j.K, if you're ever unsure of what to do, it gatlings straight into j.D for knockdown pressure instead. Don't use this as an excuse to get lazy, as Faust in the air is where most of his consistent combo damage comes from.

Faust will continue to drill until he hits the ground even after it makes contact with the opponent. It can be special canceled. Even more important then the move itself are the uses you get out of Faultless Defense Canceling it (otherwise known as the Drill Cancel). Regardless of your position in a jump, Drill canceling j.2K will immediately cause you to start falling backwards, with all air actions intact. This opens up many tricks and possible attack angles. j.2K works as a strong counterpoke option in neutral, as Faust's air FD box makes him notoriously good at squeezing over far.S-style normals (Quick, horizontal attacks that aren't so vertically-inclined). This also makes it quite the powerful move to do out of pressure. Faust can jump FD out and over many normals where a 2P would be frame-trapped, netting a punish with j.2K where he would normally get nothing.

While it's disjointed, the hitbox is only at the tip of the swipe, so it will whiff entirely at close range. Has application in combos as a way to loop back to j.K for more hits, or j.H for a high damage ender.

The enormous amount of active frames makes it an abusive move, so even though it cannot be chained or jump canceled even on block, it should be used often. Using low-to-the ground drill cancels will leave the opponent little time to respond before it recovers. It won't cover ground space so alternate attacks with j.K, j.2K and j.S to keep them guessing. One of Faust's two air combo enders (alongside j.D). Ending with j.H will do the most damage, but will allow the opponent to tech in the air.

The move is incredibly disjointed, making it very hard to anti-air, especially when you factor in that j.2K is interchangeable with it, which hits with a different timing. It's long active frames make it generally pretty great for dashing or normal jump-ins over long-winded attacks (such as fireballs, Axl's 5P/Rensen/2H, Faust's f.S/2H). Will produce much hitstun on hit, and will even stagger on counterhit resulting in an easy follow-up combo. If hit in the air, the opponent will plummet downward for 24 frames of untechable time that can lead to a knockdown when not done too high. This makes it one of Faust's two air-combo enders. It will result in less damage and shorter combos, but the knockdown is invaluable for establishing or maintaining momentum. It is however difficult to continue pressure after j.D because it has 4 extra frames of landing recovery.

It can be used as a pseudo frame-trap after special canceling normals to punish your opponent for moving after a blocked poke. Faust's longest range attack and has enough pushback to be safe on block, but keep in mind that throwing it out at neutral greatly extends Faust's hitbox, and it can be low profiled and punished. While it will hit airborne opponents, they will simply fall to ground after the hit without setting up for Withdraw. Withdraw pulls the opponent towards Faust after Re-re-re no Tsuki. This has 2 follow-ups: "Holler!" starts a linear combo that leads to a hard knockdown, or "Gettin' to the Good Part" which leads into a FB move for more damage or an air combo if used near the corner. Can link 5P after using Withdraw. Has a FRC point 43~45F, but it doesn't lead into much more reward overall. People will tend to burst either while you are reeling them in, or after you have totally reeled them in, looking to knock you down, so stay on guard. Holler! launches the opponent into the air, leaving them in a floated state for the remaining portion of the combo. It's possible for opponents bursting to whiff their burst as you perform Holler!, but it can also clip you as you raise your arm. If the opponent was dragged through poison (any distance) or coin/Chibi Faust/Chibi Robo (far from Faust) during Withdraw, then Holler! won't be confirmed, but you can still use it to get a +15 on block move. Can't Hear You! Faust flies into the air after the opponent and has invincibility for the full duration, though this only comes into play if the opponent decides to burst. He will float back down to earth quickly in the same place if you don't use the next attack. Holler Again! The final hit of the rekka-style combo; Faust karate chops the opponent and sends them plummeting to the ground for an untechable knockdown. Faust recovers in the air. If you have hit the opponent with the coin item earlier in the match, this hit will cause the opponent to catch on fire and bounce off the ground, dealing extra damage and even allowing extra combo hits by air-dashing or landing and relaunching. Oissu! Gettin' to the Good Part, Faust transforms into a batter and swings at the opponent after Withdraw. It causes the opponent to wallstick if done near the corner which can lead into a damaging combo, or it can cancelled into the follow-up FB move This One's on the House.

Will put the opponent in a great amount of blockstun, which allows Faust to start pressure, however, the move also works on Faust, so if Faust is too close when it explodes, he'll also take a hit. Faust retains his air actions after the move and can anti-air if his opponent tries to jump over it. Has an FRC point 24~25F (right after Faust tosses the bomb), which allows Faust a bit more time to start pressure or block if the opponent gets too close.

The centerpiece of Faust's design. Faust throws out a random item that produces various effects. Under normal circumstances, Faust cannot throw out a second item until the first one is gone. This causes problems if food items are thrown, so try to get rid of them as quickly as possible. You can throw out another item after a mini-Faust/Robo-Ky/Potemkin begins to walk on the ground or the poison lands, so pollute the screen to your heart's content. Using item throw in neutral is risky unless your opponent is respecting your space. A safe option is to throw items after you knock your opponent down or make them block a normal. f.S, any H button, and 2D are all prime candidates for their range and blockstun, but see the table below for exact values. Finding chances to throw items is very important to Faust's gameplan, because as long as Faust can keep chucking out dangerous items, his opponent will have to keep taking risks to approach or escape pressure.

Faust grabs onto the top of his scalpel and flings himself forward. This move will leave Faust in a special pogo stance (see below), but holding 1 will cause Faust to dismount back to neutral, even if your opponent crosses you up. After a raw 236S this leaves him at -21 on normal block. Despite what the frame data suggests, 236S doesn't hit in front of Faust until frame 17. This is because Faust actually does his 44 and 66 pogo attacks behind him and then in front of him when he performs this move, which can lead to patented Faust Hurtbox Moments. He can even hit an opponent trying to teleport behind him (Slayer, Chipp, another Faust) if timed right, which is impractical but hilarious. Similarly, either hit of the pogo mount can simply whiff depending on the placement of the opponent, such as a short character being too close to Faust when he uses it. Faust can technically continue pressure on the pogo, but it's mostly a gimmick since he can't block while on it. A savvy opponent can often punish Faust easily if he stays on it for too long. Causes a sliding knockdown on hit, which gives Faust time to throw an item and dismount, but not enough time to apply a mixup. Can be followed up with a combo if you are either in position for pogo S flower or RC > dash 2S.

If you press D during the hop, Faust will perform an attack similar to j.236D, which can lead to a full combo. Backwards smacks backwards and moves Faust back a little. Has invincible startup and pulls Faust's hitbox back a bit, so it can be used to avoid some moves and reversals while on the pogo. If you crossed up your opponent with j.236D, this can hit your opponent, and Faust will readjust himself to face the opponent afterwards. Forwards goes for a second helping of SMACK, but it has no special properties besides being crazy fast. You can use it if you think they are trying to move, but know that it's prone to being hit with reversals and has no real combo follow up on its own, so it isn't too rewarding.

Growing Flower cleanly beats air-to-airs if timed correctly, but not too much else. Has a short bit of strike invincibility, which makes it surprisingly useful if your opponent doesn't know the matchup and decides to airdash at you. I'm a Flower. Get it? A Flower? A flower pops out of the ground some distance away from Faust. It hits low, removes OTG state and launches the opponent in the air for an easy follow-up. Can catch someone trying to move after 236S, but there will always be a huge gap that can be easily jumped out of. Can continue a combo after 236S if Faust is close enough, which leads to Going My Way. Because the flower can appear offscreen if Faust is too close to the corner, this isn't always consistent (though it's pretty dang consistent). Going My Way off of the pogo. Very unsafe on block, so either use as a combo ender, or RC/FRC the move after the the last hit (frames 41-46) to continue pressure. In the corner, the RC/FRC enables a combo extension with falling j.K or j.H into 5K and a rejump. Surprise Surprise is the pogo version of the item throw.

A grounded proximity unblockable where Faust shreds his opponent with his scalpel. Although used similarly to a command grab, this move is a special case: the game will check if the opponent is within range and throwable on the frame H is input. If not, Faust does the whiff animation. If so, Faust does the attack animation, and even if the opponent jumps in that time, they'll still be caught. Allows for a follow-up combo in the corner (5P > 2S > etc.) or with RC. Although the move only activates under the same conditions as a throw, you don't actually need to FD Break when dashing to use it. Can be burst as it isn't a throw. Faust and opponents still get hit by items during the animation, so if a Bomb/Chibi/Coin is on screen or Meteors/Washpan have just been tossed it can be used in a pinch against very passive opponents at the cost of the item's raw damage. Risky to use with Bomb, but at far ranges the attack can throw the opponent into the explosion without scraping you. Due to 48 unblockable active frames and its unusual nature, this attack often leads to strange interactions with strike invulnerable and throw invulnerable moves. Against armored moves, Mettagiri will often snag one or two measly hits before either trading or getting hit anyway, making it much riskier than normal throw against opponents with armored moves. Will sometimes tag teleporting characters, who will trigger the first hit, disappear, then reappear and get hit again.

In some instances you can use the back version of the door to avoid pressure, or to get out of the corner, especially with the FRC, but never rely on it. The S version will cause Faust to appear from the sky and do a diving attack that hits overhead. Faust does a flipping animation after it hits, and can be easily punished even after landing. Worse than the door, but has two different FRC points: one before Faust finishes hiding under the rug (21~22F), and after Faust bounces off his opponent (14~17F after bounce).

Either player can reap the benefits, but they take a while to despawn, and Faust can't throw new items while they're on the ground, leaving him very vulnerable. It's important to remember that throw distance between food items is variable, and both players will be moving while this is happening - it's not impossible to chuck chocolate over an opponent's head and be unable to reach it, or to directly feed an incoming player a donut for free. Food will also sometimes not get collected by the opponent when hit by 41236K, but this is entirely dependent on when and where the item is when the opponent gets hit by it. Donuts heal some HP, but nothing else. You cannot use item throw while it is out, so you don't really want to see this. Grab it if you can, but don't get yourself killed. Donut rarely gets thrown very far from Faust, and have the shortest possible travel distance. Chocolate doesn't heal any HP but gives a nice chunk of tension. Generally better than a donut, but don't give in to the sugar addiction! May be worth picking a fight over depending on how scary your opponent is with meter and how much you need it. Travels very high and very far forwards, with the farthest possible distance of all the foods. It's not uncommon for it to go sailing over an opponent's head, leaving you with no items to use, so if your opponent doesn't feel like picking it up you can be disadvantaged. Chikuwa heals some HP, and maxes tension pulse. Anyone who knows what this does will want it, so it often forces you to pick a fight - if for no other reason than giving your opponent a maxed out tension pulse is often a complete disaster. Has the second farthest travelling distance of all the foods, often landing right in-between Faust and his opponent.

Though it only does a little damage, the coin is very active and inflicts the "Oissu?" effect on hit for the rest of the round, which increases the damage of Holler Again! and causes it to groundbounce the opponent. This also powers up 214D to give a similar higher ground bounce with much more hitstun.

This is both a useful item, and a dangerous one, because the resulting explosion hits Faust as well. When the bomb explodes, any projectile inside of it will be hit once. This will destroy some projectiles like Stun Edge, but won't stop multi-hitters like Venom's lightning balls. The Love bomb will get stuck on top of the explosion before bursting. The explosion damages chibis, instantly tagging out Mini Faust or Mini Robo ky, and taking a precious hit off Mini Pot. Most people who know the matchup at all will respect the bomb and try to escape it by jumping out of the way or blocking it - which can enable you to do throw or a blockstring into a jump-cancellable normal/door special/5D just before the bomb explodes. It can be tempting to play with fire and control/mixup your opponent with the mental frame advantage the bomb provides, but for goodness' sakes be careful.

If they want to block it then you can go for a mixup before it hits, but don't let them stuff you with a reversal, as some opponents are prone to try. All chibis are invincible in the air until they land, and Faust can throw another item after they begin moving along the ground. Faust throws an adorable mini-version of himself that will crawl along the ground after he lands and will hit the opponent once. Will float downward in a simple angle. Robo-ky is effectively similar, but will float side to side as he is falling. Controls the air a little better, so follow him, and he will create similar yomi situations to mini-Faust when he lands. Upon landing, he will change direction to go after the opponent if they are on the other side of him. Only works once, but prevents them from simply going over or under before he lands.

The meteors won't change their designated location after it goes into the air, so if the opponent moves forward, they can avoid them entirely. Just don't let them do that and you are fine. If they respect the meteors, do a mixup to make them regret it. A common example against passive opponents is Mettagiri, or air-throwing if they choose to jump and FD against meteors. Note that the spread of each individual meteor is somewhat random, so it's possible to have a very sad meteor spread that completely misses your opponent. This is pretty rare, though.

Damage Guard Startup Active Recovery On-Block Invuln   10 All 89 [86] 50       Faust throws a poison vial that has no hitbox. Once it lands, it spews a poison gas cloud. The cloud is active for nearly a full second and will still inflict poison status even if Faust is in hitstun, so it's one of his best combo breaker items. The cloud causes negligible hitstun, and the timing of the hit can be deceptive, which makes it very useful for grab mixups if your opponent decided to block it on the ground. You can throw another item after the cloud has been on the ground for a short time - about half its active frames. Note that the cloud will cause Rerere no Tsuki to drop after the first hit, but the second hit is +15 on block so you can continue pressure, or go for a reset. Beware that the hitbox can be reliably low-profiled, and advancing moves like Jam's slide, Sol's Grand Viper, or I-No's Stroke blow right through it like it isn't there at all.

Not the most effective use of 25 meter, but you are airborne on frame one with a somewhat high profile, so if you can predict lows or thin attacks it can act as a nice punish. Considering Faust's otherwise lacklustre defence, FB Chop can be an appealing "hey, why not?" option. Auto-jump installs, and will combo after 6H on some characters for enormous damage injection with followup combo. Special cancelling into this move can sometimes be useful for a surprise overhead or anti-abare button. Despite its speed, it's extremely telegraphed, so you'll usually want to go for j.2K FDC anyway. Ground bounces on hit and a potential combo follow-up, usually dash 5K or 2S depending on height. f.S connects at almost any range if you can't make it in time. On counter hit, there's even more hitstun, and your opponent will fall all the way back down to the ground. The Coin item will power up FB Chop and enforce a groundbounce similar to a counter hit, even on normal hit.

Damage Guard Startup Active Recovery On-Block Invuln   40 All 14 Until landing 1 -10     FB Pogo. Faust quickly gets on his pogo stick in midair and drops downward, taking your previous aerial angle into account. Because it's extremely fast this is a fantastic Force Break that can end up beating some anti-air attempts. Because air trajectory affects it, j.2K is a helpful for sending it on the right path for a blockstring or a combo. Faust will remain in the pogo stance after he lands, so after the initial hit, it is the same as the regular version. FB Pogo can also be used to extend combos fairly reliably for 25 meter (FB Pogo > Pogo P > Pogo Going My Way), usually from an air combo into j.D or an FDC j.K overhead into drill. The FDC extension is particularly important because it's more consistent and more damaging than a simple drill > Going My Way or trying to link off of drill.

Same as normal door       Damage Guard Startup Active Recovery On-Block Invuln   60 All 9 1 30 -17 1~8F Strike    FB Door. This is a much faster version of Faust's original K door. Because of the speed, FB Door can be an effective mixup when your opponent is preoccupied, and can punish many fullscreen attacks and zoning tools on reaction. Has a slighlty variable window to be input during the startup of 214K. Because you are unable to use the FB after the other 2 versions of the teleport, it can be predictable if used too liberally, so keep it as a surprise. Wallbounces on counter hit, usually enabling a dash 5K/2S conversion. Using the FRC timing on  6~8F, Faust can spend half his tension bar for an unpredictable mixup, notably with FRC > Hack 'n' Slash. Despite this move's incredible properties, it inherits the same inconsistent positioning as his normal door teleports, and Faust can sometimes appear in front of his opponent and whiff completely, especially if his opponent was moving backwards. Such is life.

The explosion can hit you as well, but if you hold back you'll block it just fine. Does more damage than the normal combo, but not as much damage as the version powered up by coin. The opponent falls down where they are after the explosion instead of being sent fullscreen, but blocking without FD will still push you far away. In true Faust fashion, you can even Slashback the explosion and dash forward for a combo.

This super ignores the item limits, so you can use it even if other items are already out (including after another super). By its very nature, the results from this super are completely unpredictable and can sometimes lead to a measly 4 donuts, or a deadly mix of bombs, meteors and mini-potemkins. Bombs have a tendency to override the effects of some of the other items by blowing them up, or by virtue of out-lasting the thrown items. If you are feeling adventurous, you can use the super on knockdown, or if your opponent is respecting you too much. The average results are actually pretty decent, but if you don't want to rely on faith, Meter can be more reliably dumped into other things. If you want something really exciting, item throw > item super > item super is pretty much the best possible thing you can do in a match, especially after a gold burst.

On hit starts a minigame in which you set an angel with one of the 4 buttons, and if they hit one of the three reapers, they are dealt the full damage from the super. Otherwise the super will backfire and you'll end up taking damage instead, and in some cases the opponent can even combo off of the hit. Can be combo'd into off of 6H, 2H, and multiple hits of 5H if you want a high-risk-decent-reward damage output. Failure to choose a button before your opponent results in auto-failure, so be sure to act fast. Holding a button as the super connects will place the angel before the opponent. If you whiff the full animation, or the super gets blocked, Faust will go into a unique taunt pose which can be FRC'd throughout the entire duration. The opponent can still jump over and punish you from behind before the taunt. On success (the opponent gets a Reaper), the taunt after the super can be FRC'd. This allows combo starters to hit on some characters, though not every character you can hit can be combo'd as their gravity will be messed up. 5K will hit on Pot and A.B.A meterless. While throwing caution to the wind can be fun, it's best to avoid this super unless you really need a reversal. Can be used as a combo ender in some instances, but the damage is scaled heavily to the point where it's rarely worth it.

Damage Guard Startup Active Recovery On-Block Invuln   Fatal All 5+12 4 20 -5      Total: 40 Fun instant kill hampered by its height and Faust's long IK mode activation time. Has good horizontal range, but easily low profiled. Although it's possible for items and big counterhits to give Faust surprisingly easy stuns, you're better off comboing with 6H starters instead. Additionally, characters who do not have tension bars as a result of failing to hit their IK (most likely Faust in this case) cannot pick up Chocolate but can pick up Chikuwa. Be careful. Whiffs completely on Jam, Dizzy, Kliff, Chipp, Axl, and both Sols due to their crouching stun animations. Will sometimes whiff on Baiken due to her constantly changing hurtbox while stunned.
