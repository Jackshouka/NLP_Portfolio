One of Millia's defining features is her mobility, which is among the best in the game. In addition to her two airdashes, Turbo FallGuard:Startup:Recovery:Until landing+12Advantage:, Silent ForceNo results, and aerial FB Pretty MazeGuard:AllStartup:13Recovery:Total 21Advantage:, allow her to alter her trajectory and position in the air in ways which can be difficult to follow or predict. Her Silent ForceNo results (Pin) is a fast traveling projectile that can make anti-airing or approaching her difficult. Millia also boasts strong ways of converting stray air-to-air hits into knockdowns, enhancing her neutral control. Once Millia gets a knockdown, she can use Tandem TopGuard:AllStartup:60Recovery:Total 32Advantage: or Secret GardenGuard:AllStartup:56Recovery:Total 74Advantage: to keep her opponent blocking on wakeup and run powerful OkizemeFrom Japanese "起き攻め". Attacking an opponent about to wake up after they were knocked down, usually with meaty attacks or mix-ups.. These special moves can lock the opponent down for a considerable amount of time, often forcing the opponent to block the following mixup. In addition, the combos she can get after successfully opening up an opponent will often lead into another knockdown, allowing Millia to repeat the situation. However, Millia has the second worst defense of the cast, and will take heavier damage from hits compared to most characters. Due to this, smart use of universal defensive options is necessary. Millia will also often need to play more evasively in neutral, abusing her high mobility and strong conversions to score a knockdown safely. Managing your pin and movement effectively, as well as developing flexible ways to confirm stray hits into knockdown, are central to her effectiveness.

Once she secures a knockdown, she can run extremely potent looping okizeme. Pros Cons   Amazing Mixups: Millia excels at pushing high/low and left/right mixups, and combined with a rewarding and potent tick throw game, her ability to keep the opponent guessing on defense is outstanding. Powerful Setplay: H Tandem TopGuard:AllStartup:60Recovery:Total 32Advantage: (Disc) and Secret GardenGuard:AllStartup:56Recovery:Total 74Advantage: give Millia some of the strongest setplay in the game. Her ability to regain knockdown off of pretty much every mixup option she has allows her to continuously loop her setups ad infinitum. High Mobility: Millia has access to a variety of great mobility tools, including two airdashes, a fast run with a Low ProfileWhen a character's hurtbox is entirely beneath an opponent's attack. This can be caused by crouching, certain moves, and being short., and momentum-changing special moves. Air Control: Has many strong jumping attacks that control the airspace very well, on top of her exeptional anti-airs and air mobility. Great Normals: Millia has a variety of fast, low-commitment normals useful for whiff punishing and controlling space. Corner Carry: Many of Millia's common combo routes naturally bring the opponent closer to the corner, giving Millia access to strong positioning and better okizeme. Silent Force: A fast fullscreen projectile that covers a multitude of angles, has virtually no recovery, and always leads to a full combo on air hit, giving Millia access to exceptional space control in neutral, air-to-airs, pressure resets, and routes into her strongest okizeme. Poor Defense: Has the second lowest health in the game and no meterless reversal, with her only metered reversal being underwhelming. Mediocre Damage: Overall damage is below average, with high damage with optimal routes locked behind situational starters. Millia also lacks efficient ways to boost her damage output with meter, which leaves her mix as her main threat. Pros And Cons   Starter Guide Need help getting started?

StartupThe time before an attack is active including the first active frame. For example, an attack with 10F startup means the attack will do nothing for 9 frames, then hit the opponent on the 10th frame. frames    ActiveThe active frames of an attack refers to the amount of time an attack can hit the opponent. Frames    InactiveFrames in the middle of multi-hit attacks which cannot hit the opponent, but are after the move has become active at least once.

Covers a solid area above and in front of Millia with a mostly disjointed hitbox. She can use it to stop jump-outs or to check the opponent's jump. It's safer than 6P on whiff, and its low recovery makes it a low-commitment option for this purpose. Due to its low recovery, 5P is also a key part of her burst baits, with 2P5P after throw or 5PP being solid options. Will whiff on crouching opponents.

Can hit opponents directly above her, though it's not an exceptional anti-air. Gatlings into itself (even on whiff), 2K, and 6K, allowing for a high-low mixup on block. It also gatlings into 2S, allowing for a more rewarding low option or a way to gatling into heavier normals. Primarily used for pressure, such as with the string 2K5K2K.

Useful for stopping the opponent from jumping out of the corner. Can also be used to catch techs in the corner. Also solid punish starter due to its fairly quick startup, lack of initial proration, and gatling into 2H for a full air combo.

Damage Guard Startup Active Recovery On-Block Invuln   28 Mid 7 2 16 -4      Total: 24 One of Millia's essential grounded pokes. Gatlings into 5H, which then gatlings into 2D. If you're in range, this is your main way of securing a grounded knockdown off a poke. Can also combo into Longinus for a combo from slightly farther ranges, giving you a knockdown for 25 meter and a combo in the corner. Can't confirm into a knockdown at maximum range or off a launch, but can combo into Emerald Rain.

Used less commonly than f.S, but still good to remember. Slower than f.S if not very close, but reaches farther forwards. Has more recovery than f.S, however, making it riskier to use in neutral. Also an essential piece of combo filler, with its two-hit nature making it an easy hitconfirm into 2D for a knockdown.

Leaves Millia quite vulnerable on whiff, so keep in mind if the opponent still has air options available. Opponents can land behind Millia on occasion when she uses this, which is something to avoid. Staggers on grounded counter-hit. If both hits connect, however, the second hit will undo the stagger of the first hit, making converting off a counterhit stagger difficult.

It's special cancellable on hit or block, allowing for a combo on hit without any prior setup. Also serves as a solid meaty for disc oki, providing a safer high option than Bad Moon. Invulnerable to lows for much of its animation, making it a strong low crush option. +5 on block, meaning she can continue to pressure the opponent even if they block it.

However, it knocks the opponent down on hit and is special cancellable, making it a useful combo ender. Many of Millia's corner combos end with 6H to secure a knockdown into oki. No gatling options, meaning you can't continue pressure on block without going directly into a special. Can also be used to stop jump outs in the corner.

Millia's primary pressure starter due to its frame advantage, which makes it good for frametraps and tick throws. Bigger than most similar low kicks, letting you start pressure from farther away, especially with dash momentum. Also gatlings into itself and and 5K, making it a good low option. Works well as a meaty in disc oki due to its low commitment and good hitconfirm ability. Lowers Millia's hurtbox significantly, letting you go under normals such as Johnny's f.S.

Also another solid meaty option, since it hits low and gatlings into 2H. Fairly long range and low profile makes it useful as a poke, especially since it generally confirms into knockdown. Can gatling into 5P to go backwards in the gatling table, allowing for unique pressure resets.

Can be special cancelled into K/S pin on block for pressure or used in mixups as a fast high option. It's also an important tool for Millia's air combos, as it confirms into j.S and j.H. Can hit opponents directly in front of Millia, letting it serve as an air-to-ground option, especially when used as a gatling out of other air normals.

Airdash cancellable on block, allowing for strong high-low mixups; you can either airdash again and use more high jump-ins, or you can land and use a low or throw. Also important combo filler, having enough untech time to combo into j.H.

The hitbox is almost entirely disjointed, allowing it to beat many other air normals. However, shorter range than j.D means it isn't Millia's default air-to-air from far ranges. If the opponent is close enough to beat her j.D, j.H is a better choice. Also an essential part of Millia's air combos, having high untech time and cancelling into airdash on hit for additional extensions. Try to confirm into this to get an air conversion going if you can. Whiffs on crouching opponents, making it poor for air-to-ground.

It's airdash cancellable, meaning it can be used in specific combos or to close the gap after you hit someone with it. Grants a far-reaching untechable knockdown on counter-hit, allowing Secret Garden setups from fullscreen or disc oki when close. Horrible air-to-ground move, as many characters can run or crouch under this move and punish its recovery. Has some landing recovery, making it not great to whiff, which further increases the risk of using it against grounded opponents.

Using f.S after this on block leaves a 2-frame gap, enough to punish almost all abare. On hit or block, Millia can cancel into Roll (214K) to go for a tick throw or reset pressure if the opponent's scared of the frametrap.

Can be used as a way to cancel Turbo Fall's landing recovery to catch people off guard, or as a meaty after landing raw haircar, since the knockdown from haircar doesn't give you time for other meterless setups. It's also useful as a frametrap due to its speed and decent reward in the corner or on counter-hit. In the corner, Millia can link 5P to combo from it. On counter-hit, you get a wallbounce, letting you follow up with an air combo. Causes a wallbounce from anywhere on counter-hit, allowing for damaging conversions from anywhere on the screen. Has an FRC point from 3~4F, letting you effectively remove the recovery from ground normals on block. 236H is a key part of Millia's okizeme, and the move that Disc oki is named after. Longer startup, but longer active frames as well. Can be used after a variety of knockdowns, most commonly j.2H and Bad Moon. Causes a wallbounce in the corner for combos, with similar conversions to 236S. FRC timing in 20~21F, which isn't used often because of 236D but is still is applicable in certain matchups such as Baiken. This is Millia's primary and staple mixup tool. After securing a knockdown, the Disc allows Millia to mask her high/low mixups while also making sure the opponent can't escape due to the blockstun. Some knockdowns, such as 2D > Roll > Disc, don't give enough time for the Disc to be a meaty. This can be used in conjunction with a meaty normal for a high-low mixup that's very plus on block, but be warned that this loses to reversals. Other knockdowns, however, such as low to the ground j.2H in the corner, allow the disc to hit meaty, leading to pressure that is harder to contest. Some characters have ways around Disc oki:   Faust can crawl under Disc  Zappa can duck under it  Sol can slide under it with Grand ViperGuard:Low×7, MidStartup:17Recovery:37Advantage:-21  Order-Sol can slide under it with Gun BlazeGuard:AllStartup:23Recovery:Total 44Advantage:+9  A.B.A can slide under it with DraggingGuard:Startup:Recovery:Total 28Advantage:  Robo-Ky and  Bridget can both delay their wakeups to avoid it  Slayer can pass through it with his teleport dashes Keep this in mind when performing oki on these characters. Also deceptively useful in neutral. Placing down a disc allows Millia to hide behind a constant active hitbox and potentially get a followup if the opponent runs into it. The FRC point adds to this, as it allows you to set a disc without fear of being punished on reactions by moves such as Sol's Grand Viper.

When performed with a Tiger Knee(TK) motion (doing it as close to the ground as possible by inputting 2369P), it becomes an unreactable 16 frame overhead and Millia's primary high mixup during Disc oki. Very punishable on block, so it generally should not be used in neutral or without the cover of H Tandem Top outside of combos. Has a minimum height limit. This is important to note, as it changes how to input the TK motion. Specifically, you need to wait a bit before hitting P for Bad Moon to come out. Has an FRC point a set amount of time after Millia bounces off her opponent, right as she uncurls from being a moon. This makes Bad Moon much safer on block or whiff, but Millia has other uses for 25 Tension.

Millia dives down in a 45 degree angle, giving her an extra way to cover a large distance in an unexpected way in neutral. Can also be used for mixups, as you can pass through opponents while descending for a crossup. Landing recovery is cancellable into ground specials, which can allow for a quick way to catch opponents off guard. FRC point from 14~15F, just as Millia starts moving; if you're quick enough, you can use an air normal as you descend. Has some startup before Millia starts moving. If hit out of this startup, she won't go anywhere.

Goes under a lot of things it doesn't look like it should, such as  Chipp's 2SGuard:MidStartup:7Recovery:11Advantage:-1 and 2DGuard:LowStartup:9Recovery:18Advantage:-8,  Johnny's 2HGuard:MidStartup:5Recovery:29Advantage:-16, and  Justice's 2DGuard:LowStartup:11Recovery:16Advantage:-2.

Hits low and travels forever until Millia hits her opponent or the wall. The startup looks identical to that of TK Bad Moon, making it a deceptive low mixup. This makes it Millia's preffered low option during Disc oki. The FRC point adds another layer to this; with tight timing, you can immediately input j.K before you land, allowing you to turn your low into an overhead. Should not be used from fullscreen, as it is punishable.

Useful for zoning, air-to-airs, approaching, pressure, combos, and more. Once thrown, you have to pick it back up again by crouching or rolling over it. The pin cannot be picked up for 122F (roughly 2 seconds) after throwing; you'll know it's ready to be picked up again when it begins glowing. Virtually no recovery once thrown, allowing you to quickly airdash after throwing it for an approach. Staggers on ground counter hit and has high untech time on air hit; both situations can lead to a combo. K Pin removes all of Millia's upward momentum, and its trajectory is steeper than both S Pin and H Pin. Has a slightly different use in neutral compared to S Pin, being reserved mostly for covering close approaches by the opponent, especially when punishing lows. Also useful as an "anti-anti-air." With proper spacing, K Pin can beat out some grounded anti airs and allow Millia to start a combo off the counter-hit stagger. Due to its ability to completely hault Millia's upward momentum it can be used to extend ground pressure into her airdash strings seamlessly. A good example is c.S > TK K Pin (2147K) > airdash forward > j.S. Also used after rising j.K in fuzzy guard setups to confirm into a combo without Disc or meter, and some combos or setups against certain characters (like Johnny) may require K Pin instead of S or H.   S Pin temporarily halts Millia's air movement while the pin is being thrown, and its trajectory is roughly a 45° angle downward in front of Millia. This is Millia's primary projectile and extremely crucial to her neutral game. It allows her to control the pace of the matchup, as opponents will have to keep in mind whether or not you have it available. S Pin into an immediate airdash forward is a safe and effective way to both control space and approach, even if the pin whiffs. Fishing for counter-hits is an easy way for Millia to brute force her way in due to the large amount of hitstun. If the opponent blocks it, she may still have an opportunity to continue pressure under the right circumstances due to the blockstun. It also serves as a crucial ender to some her air combos depending on height/distance to the corner; (j.214S > land > 6H) is a common way to secure a knockdown into Garden oki in the corner. H Pin Has slightly slower startup, but gives Millia an extra upward boost before throwing. Good for positioning in the air if the opponent is catching on to the angle Millia throws S Pin at. Also useful for air-to-airing, as it allows Millia to hit opponents directly above her for massive damage.

Please don't DP this                   Damage Guard Startup Active Recovery On-Block Invuln   30×5 All 56 18(8) Total 74      Once the move is input, Millia summons an orb that will accept up to four more direction inputs by pressing a direction and H (e.g. 214H -> 6H 1H 6H 4H). After 52 frames (regardless of whether any inputs were given or not), Millia will return to neutral and the orb will begin travelling along the path that was input. Once active, the projectile will persist even if Millia is hit. This makes Garden oki naturally beat both abare and reversals, as both actions will cause Garden to hit the opponent. Garden oki can cover the options previously mentioned to beat Disc oki, making Garden setups valuable against those characters. Secret Garden can be used from fullscreen after an air throw or counter-hit j.D to lock down the opponent on their wakeup, allowing Millia to safely rushdown the opponent. It can also be used in place of H Tandem Top for longer and better okizeme, but this generally requires specific setups to achieve. Long startup and counterhit state make it generally bad in neutral, however it can be used for fullscreen space control against characters that cannot approach Millia in time to interrupt it, such as Justice. Can be canceled during startup by pressing D if the situation is too dangerous to continue with the move. Common setups include S Pin > land > 6H > Garden and FB Pretty Maze > airdash back > j.D > land > 6H > Garden. Common patterns for Garden on an opponent's wakeup are 1H 6H 4H 6H when close, 2H 8H 2H 8H when farther, and 3H 8H 2H 8H when even farther than that.

It has quicker startup than H Tandem Top, making it more convenient to set up. It's also active for longer and hits three times instead of just one, allowing more time for multiple mixups. If they block the first mixup, she can simply do another one. Once active, the disc will stay out even if Millia is hit. This makes it situationally useful for trading in neutral and extremely useful for reversal-safe oki. Pretty Maze will also float on hit, giving Millia the opportunity to launch the opponent up, combo them, and reset the situation over again. Air version summons a disc in the air. This move does not operate as a "trap" like ground Pretty Maze, instead being more similar to 236S. Increases Millia's momentum on use. If you were jumping forward, you'll go forward faster after using Pretty Maze. Notably, if you airdash, then use Pretty Maze mid-flight, you'll be flung a great distance forwards or backwards at high speeds. This can be used to cover long distances fast, with IAD > Pretty Maze sending you almost the entire horizontal length of the screen at max zoom-out. This is also useful for crossups, since you can fling yourself over and behind your enemy. Due to the high untech time and ability to airdash cancel, this move is useful for stabilizing some air combos. This is especially useful against lightweight characters, who might otherwise be too high to secure a knockdown against. The FRC point lets you act almost immediately after your momentum changes, but this costs 50 Tension, so it's seldom used.

The orb activates much faster, and Millia is actionable much sooner after using it. Incredible move. This move greatly strengthens your oki, as it allows you to set up Garden oki much easier. Notably, 2D, j.2H, and Bad Moon knockdowns all set up FB Garden. This move is an extremely useful method of pressuring the aforementioned characters with responses to Disc oki, since this allows common knockdowns to be turned into strong pressure that those characters cannot easily escape. The increased speed also greatly decreases the risk of using Garden for space control, allowing you to throw it out in more situations. It is easier to consistently input all four of the move's followups by alternating H and D inputs (Ex: input 214D > 1H 6D 4H 6D/1D 6H 4D 6H instead of inputting 1H 6H 4H 6H as you would with regular Garden). As an added input note, 292X sets with FB Garden are bugged and will not work properly, so other combinations must be used.

Not a very good reversal, and should be used sparingly. The horizontal range of the rising hits is incredibly poor. This can sometimes cause opponents to fall out, especially if they were doing an extended button when you hit them. The invincibility wears off almost immediately after the startup, meaning moves such as Ky's Charged Stun Edge can beat wakeup Winger completely. The air version is mostly used to beat weaker anti-airs or for stuffing air-to-air attempts. Millia has much cheaper and less risky ways to do this, though. Not very good.
