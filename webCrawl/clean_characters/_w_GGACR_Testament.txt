Testament has two traps which persist on stage as invisible hazards. They can place ZeinestGuard:AllStartup:11Recovery:Total 29Advantage:+2, also known as Web or Net, wherever their upper body is and it will stun and ensnare opponents which touch it. HITOMIGuard:MidStartup:See notesRecovery:Total 27Advantage:, or Tree, is trap planted at their feet which launches opponents and removes OTG state for combos. Testament's other defining feature is EXE BeastGuard:AllStartup:22~81+6Recovery:Total 38Advantage:+16. EXE Beast is a projectile that travels along the ground— Beast travels forwards from Testament whereas  Beast travels from behind the opponent towards Testament. One of each version of EXE Beast can be active at a time, and their timings can be manually adjusted by holding and releasing the attack button. With their powers combined, Testament can enforce one of the scariest advantage states in the game. To supplement EXE Beast and their traps, Testament has Phantom SoulGuard:AllStartup:30Recovery:Total 58Advantage:+2—commonly as Skull. Skull is a projectile which applies a curse status effect to the opponent on hit. The force break version is especially noteworthy because it applies the curse status on block as well as on hit. The curse status, causes Testament's crow to autonomously attack the opponent. Curse opens up even more flexibility in pressure and screen control, and even makes new routes possible, including unblockables. In addition to their core traps and projectiles Testament also boasts a diverse toolkit featuring teleports, and a counter which applies a poison damage over time effect on hit, as well as a unique resource in the form of dolls. They do a lot very well, and have very few weak points, which helps make the character accessible for new players, and their high skill ceiling handsomely rewards players who are diligent in training mode. After all, you have to be top tier to have the Bible named after you.

Pros Cons   Consistency & Flexibility: Testament is very stable thanks to the nature of how their combos work, and even their random element has consistent branching choices. The character offers not only tools that deal with most situations, but also has combo routes which can let you pick your knockdown, curse status, and screen position freely. Meter Mania: Testament gains meter very easily, and has numerous good options to spend meter including but not limited to FB SkullGuard:Startup:80Recovery:Total 35Advantage:, Grave DiggerGuard:AllStartup:14Recovery:16+3 after landingAdvantage:-8, Master of PuppetsGuard:MidStartup:7+4Recovery:41Advantage:-24, and good FRC points. Defines the Match's Pace: Testament's disjointed hitboxes, Skulls, Nets, and EXE Beasts are all potent options for keeping the opponent at bay. Because opponents are forced to hit nets to remove them, block or slashback skulls, and avoid trees Testament can establish a firm control over the pace of the match. Smothering Okizeme: With access to left-right mixups from EXE Beasts, fast overheads from 6P, and unblockable setups with curses, Testament has a decent amount of mix-up potential if they get set up. Furthermore, they can extend their pressure for long periods of time with little risk if they spend tension for FRCs. Master of Puppets: It's difficult to understate how valuable MoP is. Building the meter and situation to access this super defines the modern meta for Testament play. The access to knockdowns and Dolls it provides is invaluable. Throw Reward: From a ground throw, Testament gets access to either curse or a strong follow-up combo. Testament's air throw instead rewards with a doll. These factors make throw a very rewarding option. Benefits from Patience: Because their traps act autonomously, Testament is able to gain advantage against the opponent while blocking. Phantom Soul's Curses, HITOMI, and EXE Beast can bail Testament out while they are blocking. Delayed Nightmare CircularGuard:AllStartup:0+226Recovery:Total 21Advantage: can steal their turn back both while blocking and mid combo. "They need it": Testament's specials have unintuitive properties which make them very tricky to deal with, notably: EXE Beast, once released, persists if Testament gets hit. HITOMI cannot be blocked in the air without FD. Enhanced HITOMI don't go away when Testament is hit. Net removes 1 active frame from moves, effectively removing some low-active-frame moves from existence. Poison can deal unscaled damage during moments of non-interaction. Vulnerability in the air: Testament does not like to be in the air unless it's on their own terms. Their air buttons are good, but they have lengthy recovery. They lose access to most of their strong tools and forcing Testament into the air can disrupt their gameplan and allow the opponent to gain an advantage. Big target: They have big hurtboxes, making them susceptible to fuzzy overheads and extended combos. Escaping on defense, moving or evading in general can be difficult in certain matchups. Buttons may also extend hurtboxes, which is vulnerable to counterpoking. Unique Mechanics Curse  Curse Testament's Phantom Soul (Skull) special applies a curse to the opponent on hit which causes their pet crow to automatically attack the opponent independent of Testament themselves. The crow has 4 different attacks (noted below), which it will use in 4 different patterns. Note that the K skull patterns are longer than the P skull patterns. Using any version of Phantom Soul while the opponent is cursed will immediately end their current curse. Curse patterns (K extensions noted in parentheses):  Dive, Dive, Overhead, Feathers, Tackle (Dive, Overhead, Overhead) Feathers, Overhead, Dive, Tackle, Tackle (Dive, Overhead, Feathers) Tackle, Feathers, Dive, Overhead, Feathers (Overhead, Tackle, Dive) Overhead, Overhead, Tackle, Feathers, Feathers (Dive, Tackle, Tackle)  Dolls  Dolls  Whenever Testament air throws an opponent or hits them with Master of Puppets, Testament gains between one and three dolls (up to maximum of 4). Whenever Testament places a net or a tree while in possession of one or more dolls, a doll will be consumed and an enhanced version of the trap will be created instead of the default version.

FB Skull can force most opposing characters to crouch which gives Testament a free curse or combo, and EXE Beast can be used to catch the opponent attempting to escape or punish 6P.

As combo filler enables badlands loops, counter hit and crouching hit confirms off of f.S/2S, and more. As a pressure tool, its very long delay cancel window enables frametraps into 5H with very high reward. You can use this button to reset pressure with EXE BeastGuard:AllStartup:22~81+6Recovery:Total 38Advantage:+16 meterlessly when you conditioned them with frametraps. Cancelling into 6H is particularly nice at catching them trying to jump. As an anti-air, it covers a surprisingly high area diagonally up and in front of Testament and the cancel options allow combos afterwards, but the forward step means it isn't as effective if they're closer to them. It is also particularly useful to catch opponents who attempt to jump out of EXE BeastGuard:AllStartup:22~81+6Recovery:Total 38Advantage:+16 pressure. Grounded hits can be comboed into 5H when opponent is standing or 6H when they're crouching or counter-hit. On air hit you can convert into badlandsGuard:AllStartup:17Recovery:13+15 after landingAdvantage:-13 and on air counter-hit you can pickup with S beastGuard:AllStartup:22~81+6Recovery:Total 38Advantage:+16. Cancelling into 6P is another sneaky pressure reset and frametrap that hits them overhead and can be an unexpected combo reset. You don't have a low option, unless you spend meter to cancel with H Beast FRC. Be warned that this attack is fairly slow, easy to counter-hit, has a blind spot, and is unsafe if uncancelled (and sometimes when cancelled, depending on the option chosen). Can be very risky to use if they counterpoke you, because it's airborne state before startup and the opponent gets a lot of untech time on air CHs to convert into big combos. The only gapless/safe option off of 6K on block is 5H, but it may whiff at max range.

It extends a big hurtbox in startup, however the hurtbox during recovery frames is small. How unsafe it is depends on match up, their tools to punish and your spacing.

See the OTG Skull Quick Reference to see how to hit each character with 236P. Midscreen throw does not reward a combo on  Venom.

If it hits, the opponent is marked with a "curse", that causes the crow accompanying Testament to begin attacking. The crow has 4 different attacks (noted under Curse Attacks), which it will use in 4 different patterns. Note that the K skull patterns are longer than the P skull ones. Disappears if it goes offscreen, or if Testament is hit. The former can lead to P Phantom Soul OTGs whiffing if Testament is too close to the corner. P skull remains active in front of you and can deal with ground approaches well. You can otg them using P skull and get easy access to curse from a knockdown. When they're cursed, the crow attacks 5 times. K skull travels horizontally slowly and is great at controlling air space. On air CH you can convert into a combo from it.

This can cover jump outs, and oftentimes will chase techs for you, such as after OTG Phantom Soul. Dive is pretty much the same as Tackle, but the crow aims directly at the opponent. Serves as a neutral annoyance, as well as filling gaps in pressure. Feathers fires a spray of three feathers in an outwards fan pattern. The actual projectiles are slower than the tackles, but it covers more space and offers better lockdown on connect. Overhead is a delayed overhead, where the crow homes in on the opponent's location within a certain radius and swipes downwards with a scythe. The attack has insanely long untech time, all but guaranteeing a knockdown, and can be combined with 2K or 2D for unblockables. Note that the the difference in the P skull and the K/D skull's patterns is done by the two having a different duration for the curse, the P skull lasts for 600 frames (10 seconds) and K/D lasts for 1020 frames (17 seconds). This also means that in rare circumstances it's possible to get extra curse attacks because some of the curse attacks finished faster than intended. If you taunt Testament will interact with the crow and it won't attack till the animation finishes. Useful when doing okizeme for changing the timing of the crow attack. You can cancel the taunt with FD to adjust the timing. Example with doing curse regularly, the succubus hits too early and misses. Example with using taunt to delay the curse attack and make it hit meaty.

Two hit move which knocks the opponent behind Testament. Floats on hit, meant to start/set up a combo. Pickups depend on spacing and opponent's weight or hurtbox, usually f.S or 6K. Commonly used to knock an opponent into a net or tree. The air version is generally preferred over the grounded version, because it has more untechable time on hit and it's safer on block or whiff. The 1st hit has significantly more untechable time, and if the 2nd hit whiffs it allows you to extend combos, or set up your best okizeme options. Effective in neutral when TKed. It has a strong disjointed hitbox that controls a lot of space on the ground and in the air. It can crush many moves, anti-air, catch backdashes, punish summons, etc. It is an option that forces respect from the opponent and creates hesitation. Once the opponent slows down and hesitates when the threat of badlands is established, Testament can benefit from it by being able to place summons easier on screen. It is difficult to punish, unless they IB or SB the 2nd hit. If they can't punish you can RPS with: warrant, backdash, grave digger, NC, mash etc. Becomes a powerful combo starter if you have traps placed behind you. Can be used in synergy with summons to stay advantageous after landing, such as EXE beast, Tree or FB skull.

Beasts are a way to keep a ton of pressure and an option that makes the opponent either block or jump. They are both offensive and defensive. Since they keep moving after you let them loose, they can hit opponents, even if they hit you. They have a short cooldown before you can release them when you summon. Can be held to delay the move's activation, then release with negative edge or by tapping the button again. Beasts disappear if you're hit while they're in standby, but they keep attacking if you released them. Both S and H beasts can be used simultaneously on screen. S beast is your main ranged pressure and okizeme tool. It acts as a harassment tool, one that forces your opponent to deal with you. It's an amazing counterpoke tool from far range that can hit the opponent from behind them while they zone, summon, setup, charge, bloodpack etc. You use S beast when they're playing passive or keeping their distance doing stuff. Will force the opponent to Dead Angle in the wrong direction if they attempt it. Can be used in conjunction with Lucht Warrant for crossup setups. Comes with an FRC about halfway into its startup for safety or for some okizeme setups. H beast, besides okizeme and pressure, is really versatile and important to help you get started in neutral. It can be a strong defensive wall in front of you that controls a lot of space horizontally and creates hesitation from the opponent. If the opponents approaches carelessly you can release it and hit them. If the opponent hesitates you get to summon more traps. It is more advantageous on block and it has more untech time on hit than S beast. Has an extremely wide FRC window on frames 2-9 for immediately allowing Testament to take another action. This is amazing used offensively for frame advantage, but also defensively when used in a gap to setup a beast on screen and challenge their offense. Can be used as a situational anti-air, since it's quick to come out and you can block and then release the beast to hit them. Tips on how to use it for offense. H Beast FRC.

Testament will freeze you in hitstop, teleport behind and attack with a strike that poisons in 24F. The counter window is active for 18 frames and can be difficult to punish if the opponent isn't ready for it. Can lead to high damage combos with poison, if traps are placed behind you or if you FRC it. Very unsafe on block, but can be RC/FRC'd for safety or combo followups. Some counterplay options:  Generally can be beaten with throws, fast recovery buttons with little hitstop or falling with an air button/safejump then block, jump cancel and block (has to be FDed in the air), moves with forward momentum that can make the followup whiff (ABA's rekka 1Guard:MidStartup:12Recovery:17Advantage:-5). Testament teleports behind you to attack, however if you crouch block you don't have to swap guard, due to extended crossup protection(9F). If used as a reversal on wakeup it will also lose to meaties. Keep your blockstrings tight and use lows to catch them buffering the input. The warrant input is 214K and they have to stand up doing it. Match the low with the timing they would stand up. Check if your character has an Option SelectA technique where one command (or series of commands) will perform a different action depending on the circumstances, thereby allowing one action to be able to handle two distinct situations. (OS) that you can do to beat it automatically.

The animation looks like Testament is standing still while a gust of wind disturbs their hair and robe. It deactivates if Testament is hit. Trees pop up when the opponent passes over them. If it connects, it launches them and allows for combo followups. It is a strong defensive tool you can sit behind patiently, it can trigger and hit them while you're blocking. Can work as an anti-air, since the attack comes out while you're blocking. Can have a max of 2 at one time. Comes with an FRC to make the planting animation much safer and potentially bait a punish attempt. Knocks down on counter hit. Powered Up Hitomi is larger and poisons the opponent on hit. Does not deactivate if Testament is hit, forcing the opponent to remain even more aware than before. It is possible to have 2 normal trees and 2 powered up ones on the field, for a maximum of 4. They're treated as separate summons, so if you place a regular tree it replaces another regular tree and if you place a poison tree it only replaces another poison tree. Launches even higher than normal trees and has far greater untech time. Leads to high damage combos because poison ignores guts and defense modifier. It does around 100ish extra damage by itself. With 2 or 3 dolls you can can extend combos for absurd amount of damage by refreshing poison over and over via MOP loops. The best spot a tree can be is directly in front of Testament, where the opponent would have to stand to attack you on the ground. Jumping over will put the opponent in reach of your anti-airs. The next best spot, especially for empowered trees, is behind Testament, where you can use badlands to juggle them backwards into the tree for a combo starter. The opponent can trigger the trees to get rid of them by getting close in their proximity. For example, they can jump over it, dash FD block, dash throw or use an invulnerable move / armor / parries to avoid the activation. Trees must be FD blocked in the air. They remove OTG state on hit, allowing Testament to perform some very unusual combos. Example with MOP. Example with NC.

The animation looks like they're spraying their own blood into the air. Zeinest does not deactivate when Testament is hit. It forces the opponent to structure their pressure, combos, and approach differently. It is a versatile and passive screen control option, also one of the best things to just slyly plant if your opponent isn't rushing you. You can place it at tons of heights, it can be both a ground or air deterrent. Strong when placed behind you as well, since it turns BadlandsGuard:AllStartup:17Recovery:13+15 after landingAdvantage:-13 and WarrantGuard:Startup:Recovery:Total 52Advantage: into combo starters. Can work as an anti-air. Can have a max of 2 at one time. Persists on screen for 10 seconds. Okizeme tool that is useful for when you want a wall to keep them there, however it doesn't hit them while they're crouching. Effective deterrent against reversals like Sol's Riot StampGuard:High/AirStartup:9 after reaching wallRecovery:3 after landingAdvantage:-4~, Faust's FB ChopGuard:High/AirStartup:19Recovery:12Advantage:+1 or Slayer trying to BDC(backdash cancel) jump out of the corner. Can be used to force clashes against invulnerable moves such as Sol's Volcanic ViperGuard:MidStartup:7Recovery:21+10 after landingAdvantage:-28. The net hurtbox takes priority over yours, so it just counts as 2 disjointed hitboxes connecting. Example. Air Zeinest can be used for stalling to change your air momentum and help you beat grounded anti-airs. Controls a lot of air space and can prevent the opponent from airdashing freely. Powered Up Zeinest is indicated by the purple skeleton on hit and is mostly used as a combo tool. Holds opponent in place for MUCH longer than normal nets and does not break when Testament hits the opponent, which allows for some interesting combos. While these can be destroyed the same way as the normal ones, when an opponent attacks one, they will be stuck in hitstop for 9F in addition to losing an active frame. It is possible to have 2 normal nets and 2 powered up ones on the field, for a maximum of 4. Persists on screen for 7 seconds. Nets can be removed by attacking or blocking them. When attacked, causes the opponent's attack to lose 1 active frame. If you disable the net with an attack there's no cooldown and Testament can summon another net right away. However if you disable it by blocking, Testament is in a little cooldown and has to wait before summoning a net again. Moves with 2 or less active frames can be neutralized with 2 nets. For example, you can use them to be safe against Justice's Michael BladeGuard:MidStartup:9+4Recovery:46Advantage:-14, which is only 2 frames active. Since her super is fullscreen, you completely avoid it even if the nets are behind you. Another example, Sol's 5H, since it's only 2 frames active it will whiff if you're surrounded by 2 nets while he tries to hit you.
