Anji's main mechanic is his autoguard, which allows him to block during portions of some of his normal attacks. Strong use of Autoguard normals allows Anji to punch through his opponents offense quite easily or bait them into frametraps. Helping this along is Anji's signature FuujinGuard:MidStartup:20Recovery:27Advantage:-16, a fast lariat that can be followed up with a number of options. Fuujin is useful for anything from pressure to mixups to neutral, making it an excellent move to rely on throughout a match. After Anji gets a hard knockdown, he can perform ShitsuGuard:AllStartup:21Recovery:Total 48Advantage:-7 to keep his opponent blocking while he runs up to perform a mixup or engage in pressure. Fuujin, Autoguard, Butterfly Oki, Late-Cancelling and 3S Cancelling (the latter two of which are explained below) come together to make Anji very tricky to deal with as a defender, and his extensive mixup game with a variety of lows, overheads, and throws makes his offensive reward quite high overall. While Anji has good answers to everything his opponents can do, he has a notable vulnerability to moves with low-profile properties. While Anji can call out high and mid attacks with plenty of autoguard moves, his only autoguard low normals are 3K, 3S and 2H, all of which are committal. While Anji can often autoguard mids and highs on reaction, autoguarding lows tends to be done as a read on the opponent, making it inherently more risky to do. Failure to pick the right option will put Anji into a precarious situation, so familiarize yourself with his kit very well. Unaware opponents can be run over by him quite soundly, while experienced foes will force Anji to mix up which autoguard he uses with his other tools to greater effect. As well, while Fuujin is very useful, enemies who can stuff Fuujin consistently will force Anji to rely on other options for winning the match. Anji's low execution, strong fundamentals and accessible toolkit make him a great pick for both new players and veterans. Players who enjoy hard reads, strong offense and solid defense will love Anji and his fanciful fighting style.

Pros Cons   Specialist Attacks: Normals like 5P and 5S are buttons which dominate within their roles. This concept extends to other parts of his kit, where Anji's options demand specific responses, because they are so strong at specific things. Belligerent Defense: Fuujin, Autoguard, and a powerful Throw OSA shorthand for "Option Select"A situation where you perform an input and the game will "select an option" automatically depending on what the other character did. enable disrespectful style in which Anji can blow through attacks and make the opponent play his game. No Jumping: Both in terms of anti-airs and air-to-airs, Anji has it made. He's great at harassing opponents who jump with jumps of his own, and he has great anti-airs if he chooses to plant his feet. Meter Dump: Strong and linear meter use means he can turn just about any touch into 150+ damage, corner carry, and oki on almost the entire cast. Gatling God: His permissive gatling table and uniquely delayable gatling timings give Anji an unmatched degree of freedom and expression in how he sequences his normals. Clean Movement: Thanks to a good run speed, super jump arc, and momentum altering moves, Anji can work himself into just the right spot on the screen. Specialist Attacks: The specialized nature of Anjis moves force him to become very selective of his normals, which imposes a mental stack tax. It's a double-edge sword where he has great choices, but he has to spend mental effort picking the right ones. Guard Bar: Anji has the worst guard bar stats in the game. Combine this with his slightly below average defensive stats, as well as some niche interactions with autoguard, and Anji can be punished hard for blocking. Okizeme Dabbler: Anji isn't like oki-specialist characters who can apply some degree of mix while staying reversal-safe; he is either running mix and unsafe, or just doing a meaty and preparing to block. Air-To-Ground Options: Although great for contesting air space, Anji's air options are not strong options for hitting a grounded opponent. Hitbox Issues: Moves which hit below Anji's waist can be difficult to play around. This extends beyond the realm of low profile moves like  Sol's Ground ViperGuard:Low×7, MidStartup:17Recovery:37Advantage:-21 and becomes a general point to play around. Unique Mechanics Autoguard  Autoguard (also known as Guard Points or GP) Several of Anji's moves have a property where they will automatically block moves that make contact, depending on the type of move: Low Autoguard will only block lows, and High Autoguard will block mid and high attacks. He can cancel his move into one of four Autoguard Followups if he blocks something during autoguard, and these are very fast and in some cases are guaranteed to connect. 6K, 1~7F High Guardpoint       6S, 7~12F High Guardpoint       6H, 13~20F High Guardpoint       5D, 4~18F High Guardpoint       236H~H, 8~26F High Guardpoint       236H~D, 2~20F High Guardpoint           3K, 1~4F Low Guardpoint       3S, 1~27F Low Guardpoint       2H, 10~19F Low Guardpoint           Kou, P during Guardpoint       Sou, K during Guardpoint       FB Kou, D during Guardpoint       Kachoufuugetsu, 63214S during Guardpoint       Unique Gatling Options  Unique Gatling Options Anji's unique Gatling options and array of command normals give him freeform blockstrings and unique combo options. Late Cancel - Anji's normals have a property in which they can all be cancelled at any point during their active and recovery frames into a normal or special move as long as they made contact, giving Anji the ability to turn any gatling string into a Frame Trap. Example link, turn on the CC for explanation 3S Cancel - 3S is a particular normal that can be cancelled during frames 7-9 of its startup into 5S or 5H, allowing for very unique blockstrings and cancels that other characters cannot perform. Example Link Wide Gatling Tree - Anji has a large number of command normals and gatlings, along with many ways to get into them. This along with 3S cancelling allows him to apply strong mix, frame trap, and crank guard bar really well. Starter Guide   Starter Guide Need help getting started?

It is large, lightning fast, and prone to favorable trades due to its high attack level. 5P has limited options for gatlings, generally leaving you reliant on 3S cancels for more substantial grounded conversions. 5P will, however, freely combo into 5H on crouching hit and counterhit, making it superb for fast punishes on crouch-recovery moves like  Ky's Greed SeverGuard:High/AirStartup:18Recovery:5+11 after landingAdvantage:-14 or  Slayer's sweepGuard:LowStartup:7Recovery:12Advantage:-8. Furthermore, the fact that Potemkin and Justice cannot crouch block under 5P makes it positively domineering in those matchups, letting Anji convert hits that would be inconsequential in other matchups into corner-to-corner carry. Is a great anti-air that can catch a lot of approaches. Will whiff on all crouching characters except Potemkin (always hits) and on Justice (hits block/proximity block, whiffs on neutral crouch) Gatling Options: 6P, 3P, 6K, 3S, 5H, 6H, 5D, 2D   FRC Window Proration Guard Bar+ Guard Bar- Level   N/A  10 7 3    5K  Tabber requires Javascript to function.

It boasts decent range and a high attack level, and forces crouch on hit, opening the door to some of Anji's most essential combos. 5H is guaranteed to combo into 236H on grounded hit, launching opponents for a great blend of damage and corner carry, especially with meter invested. Put simply, routing into 5H is part of your win condition in many matchups. On airborne hits, 5H knocks down, where you can take advantage of Anji's delayed cancels by late canceling into 236P to get some of Anji's best okizeme. On block, 5H is a little more nuanced. Its high attack level means it leads to a good amount of pushback, but cancels from 5H can be quite hard to challenge. Accordingly, using 5H in block pressure can be quite powerful when applied well, but may force you to disengage or lean on 236H to make up for lost space. Generally what you want to combo into after a mixup.

Its frame one high/mid autoguard means it can be used as a reversal when paired with its followups, though if your opponent delays their meaty or goes low, you will get counterhit. Additionally, 6K is quite potent when used as a callout against frame traps and projectile-based pressure resets. Aside from being used as a reversal with autoguard followups, 6K sees some use as an anti-air and anti-poking autoguard due to its short length compared to 6H and 5D, though 6K suffers from a relatively small catch window, and 6S has more use as an actual poke with an autoguard. 6K's only gatling is 3P, which acts as a wide frame trap (7f gap) to discourage punishment when 6K is not cancelled. While not a gatling, 6K can also be late cancelled into 5K on hit, block, or whiff during its last 10 frames, which leaves a 5f gap on block as an alternate frame trap. 6K also has an FRC on its first two active frames, which are somewhat niche but quite powerful. First and foremost, it allows for a much greater degree of safety, since the FRC is only four frames after 6K's autoguard window ends. On block, 6K FRC is a whopping +13, which is a huge amount of pressure to squeeze out of an 11f move with many gatlings into it. This advantage applies to combos as well, where it can be used to extend ground combos or put together character-specific extensions after On. This FRC shares its timing with autoguard hitstop should Anji catch something with 6K, meaning the following option selects are available:  6K > FRC (PKS) - Kou on autoguard, FRC on block/whiff 6K > FRC (KSH) - Sou on autoguard, FRC on block/whiff 6K > FRC (Any Three+D - FB Kou on autoguard, FRC on block/whiff; must be precise or you risk using your Gold Burst Gatling Options: 3P   FRC Window Proration Guard Bar+ Guard Bar- Level   11~12FThe first two active frames; FRC immediately as the move hits  10 7 3   Staggers on ground CH (max 33F) Cancelable into 5K from 25F onwards  3K  Tabber requires Javascript to function.

Unfortunately, 6S's hitbox is deceptive and only hits on the ends of the fans. This makes using 6S up close a risky option. Has many gatling options.

When leveraged properly within its niches, 6H will seem oppressive, but brute forcing it almost anywhere else will leave you feeling wildly underwhelmed. Sporting a decently sized- albeit late- mid/high autoguard window and a reasonable amount of throw invulnerability, 6H is generally used as a frame trap on block and combo stabilizer on hit. In block pressure, 6H is a great way to check for the opponent getting squirrely in pressure, especially with how many moves gatling into it. It will frame trap high/mid mashes, blow clean through Dead Angle Attacks when timed properly, throw bait, and bring Anji closer to the opponent. Special mention should be given to 6H's "sit down and shut up" factor in butterfly oki against characters with tools that can singlehandedly derail butterfly okizeme when not contained, such as DanzaiGuard:MidStartup:18Recovery:25Advantage:-9 or the followups to FB DandyGuard:Startup:Recovery:Total 38Advantage:. In that same vein, 6H works quite well as a tool for calling out backdashes. On hit, 6H pulls double duty as a damage engine and combo stabilizer. Though its prorate of 80% dings Anji's damage quite a bit, after strong starters, 6H can burn through health bars. The float caused by 6H on hit allows easy entry into S Fuujin (H Fuujin on counterhit), both on and near the ground, with some per-character variation. This is especially useful on characters that can be difficult to S Fuujin loop, where 6H has enough hitstop to allow for height adjustments by delaying your cancel into S Fuujin. 6H also has an FRC right before it hits, which allows for sneaky throws and pressure resets, though 25 meter is not exactly cheap for a throw. Similar to 6K, 6H's FRC overlaps with its autoguard, meaning the following option selects are possible:  6H > FRC (PKS) - Kou on autoguard, FRC on block/whiff 6H > FRC (KSH) - Sou on autoguard, FRC on block/whiff 6H > FRC (Any Three+D - FB Kou on autoguard, FRC on block/whiff; must be precise or you risk using your Gold Burst  FRC Window Proration Guard Bar+ Guard Bar- Level   17~20FFRC immediately before the move hits 80% 14 6 4    2P  Tabber requires Javascript to function. “Whatever you do will be insignificant, but it is very important that you do it.”            Frames 5-6       Frames 7-8       Damage Guard Startup Active Recovery On-Block Invuln   8 Mid 5 4 6 0      Total: 14 Anji's 2P is a fast and close ranged pressure tool.

The primary effect of being hit at a higher height is that Anji no longer is in counter hit state from frames 3-4, but it also leads to strange interactions such as: No meter gain on Gold Burst. No burst refill on Blue Burst. No level up from Johnny's coin. No follow-up animation from cinematic supers and instant kills.

Notably, j.D halts Anji's horizontal and vertical movement early in its startup frames, though this movement halting is not frame one; j.D cannot be FDC'd in a useful manner. This air stall is superb for keeping your movement unpredictable and baiting anti-airs, especially since Anji recovers fast enough to airdash or jump after even the lowest of j.Ds. j.D is shockingly disjointed, making it a potent air-to-air, especially when paired with its movement stopping and Anji's special superjump, effectively letting you place a giant stop sign anywhere in the air. On normal hit, j.D knocks the opponent away with a highly untechable hit, capable of knocking down low to the ground, or comboing into j.214P for a knockdown. On counterhit, j.D is massively untechable and will wallstick should the opponent reach the wall. j.D also has a special property where it can be canceled into any non-j.D air normal from frame 23 onward, allowing for character-specific followups, including j.D > landing j.K/S > 5P for a rejump, or j.D > j.H for a knockdown.

Upon input, Anji sends out a butterfly at about leg height. If it comes in contact with the opponent or a projectile, the butterfly transforms into a hawk before leaping into the sky and falling to the ground. The hawk projectile hits twice on the way down, both of them as Mids. Shitsu has two purposes. The first is in neutral as a high committal zoning option for a grounded approach. While the projectile is slow, if enemies interact with it at all then they will have to deal with the hawk followup. While not amazing, using Shitsu to gain space can be a decent way for Anji to make his way in against opponents who like to stay on the ground. Shitsu's second purpose, and its more important one, is in okizeme. Upon getting hard knockdown on his opponent, Anji can throw out Shitsu and guarantee a mixup attempt. Many of Anji's single-hit mixup moves, like 3P or 3K, can be thrown out inbetween the butterfly hitting the opponent and the hawk falling onto them, which will allow a full combo with good timing. Shitsu forms the backbone of Anji's mixup game and is an extremely important move to utilize nearly every chance you can get. Shitsu has a few weaknesses. Not only is it slow, but the projectile also disappears if Anji is hit. Thus, Anji players will have to correctly space and time their butterfly oki to the best of their ability to avoid a reversal attempt. 6K can help with checking for reversal attempts in butterfly oki.

Fuujin is an advancing and highly damaging lunging strike that sees use across every facet of Anji's game plan. S Fuujin and H Fuujin are pretty distinct, each with different uses. On block, both Fuujins share the same flaw; they lock you into the same set of five reactable followups, each with well-understood counterplay. While ill-prepared or scared opponents may not challenge your followups, savvy opponents will be able to snipe you out of most followups with ease. Regularly routing into Fuujin followups on block will leave you dependent on an ignorant/scared opponent, ambitious conditioning, or meter use to consistently stay safe. At the same time, Fuujin is a great gap closer in block pressure, and can be used to mitigate natural pushback and faultless defense alike. S Fuujin is one of the key features of Anji's grounded and corner combos. Owing to its lack of invulnerability and minimal horizontal movement, S Fuujin does not see use in neutral and pressure like H Fuujin. On grounded hit, S Fuujin combos into Nagiha and nothing else. On air hit (including 2D), however, S Fuujin will floorslide. On most charactersEveryone except A.B.A., Johnny, Order-Sol, Potemkin, and Robo-Ky, 2D > 236S  will let you combo into FB Rin for a launch, which is one of Anji's staple combo routes. From higher hits, 2D > 236S~D works on everyone, and will even let you link normals from S Fuujin's floorslide. In the corner, S Fuujin can be looped on many characters (most notably Potemkin and Testament, where it can fund and lead into unblockable loops) for high damage, great meter gain, and Anji's signature okizeme. H Fuujin is highly threatening in neutral, boasting enough forward movement and invuln to blow through preemptive pokes and fast projectiles, though reactive and highly active moves will win out in these situations. With this partial invuln, it can also be used as a reversal, albeit a flawed one, losing to delayed meaties and throws. Proper use of H Fuujin on wakeup can leave opponents scared to pressure you, especially when paired with Anji's wakeup autoguard normals, but overuse will just hand your opponent counterhits on a silver platter. On hit, H Fuujin launches and wallbounces, which is why it sees use in basically every major combo Anji has. With proper routing and meter use (see: FB Rin), you will be able to take every character in the game from corner to corner, while also scoring solid okizeme. Even without meter, H Fuujin opens up opportunities for substantial air combos by linking normals off of 236H~K.

Anji leaps into the air and throws down several fans in a cone below him. Can be airdashed out of, which allows Anji to back off or press forward depending on the situation. This move is the best option for establishing a safe gameplan as Anji. Opponents will likely be too stunned to move the first few times you use it out of Fuujin, which can net a full pressure reset. Don't become overly reliant on it, however. The entire cast can punish Anji for using it by anti-airing or air-to-airing his ascent. Using the FRC point at 6-8F makes the move completely safe, which is useful for baiting reversal attempts.

Anji leaps a great distance forwards before landing in neutral. Often puts Anji at just the right space for a throw, which can lead into solid butterfly oki. Anji can potentially cross up depending on spacing. This move is great for getting into your opponents head. The threat of a throw or crossup makes this move very useful in butterfly oki mixups or even general Fuujin pressure. The leap going over lows allows Anji to punish opponents who are trying to fuzzy low his other followups. The move's biggest downside is that it puts Anji in counterhit state until he lands, and can be readily thrown on reaction during its landing recovery.

Anji sweeps his fan outwards, knocking the opponent off their feet. Nagiha is one of Anji's staple combo enders, granting a knockdown on opponents on or very near the ground, allowing for pressure midscreen and guaranteed butterfly oki in the corner. If delayed, Nagiha acts as a potent frame trap, especially against opponents preemptively trying to challenge Rin. This frame trap opens up strong combo opportunities, though meter investment may be necessary on some characters. Nagiha's FRC is also one of Anji's best, and should be a priority for anyone playing Anji eventually. On block, Nagiha FRC is great for maintaining pressure, as using it keeps Anji safe on normal block - or you can be more aggressive and FRC into one of Anji's frame one autoguards or H Fuujin to stuff punish attempts. Against more passive opponents, it may be possible to try to retake your turn, though this will be stretching the bounds of your frame advantage quite significantly. On hit, Nagiha's FRC lets you upgrade smaller Fuujin confirms, tack on extra damage in the corner, and generate butterfly oki midscreen where it otherwise might not be possible.

Rin sees some use as a tool for ending pressure safely on hesitant opponents and challenging abare, though it has a few uses in combos as well. In pressure, much like the rest of Fuujin's followups, Rin is far too slow to be used as a real high/low mixup, and can be interrupted low or Slashbacked on reaction. That said, Rin can be quite potent as a timing mixup when opponents preemptively attempt to mash on or jump out of Fuujin, especially when paired with its massive 18f high/mid catch window and generous throw invulnerability. At the very least, it is 0 on normal block, should you be able to convince someone to hold it. It should be noted that Rin's autoguard and throw invuln are not comprehensive; Rin can be interrupted by mids before its autoguard goes active and right before it hits (the move's frame data is somewhat misleading here; Rin takes roughly four more frames than its noted startup to connect on standing opponents), and can be thrown before it connects, which is usually aided by Rin's forward movement. On hit, Rin is exclusively used as a combo ender to guarantee knockdowns, since it can hit far higher than Nagiha- directly above Anji's head- and always knocks down, giving butterfly oki from good spacings and heights. On counterhit, Rin is surprisingly awkward. It burns through a lot of RISC, meaning it stunts combo damage quite significantly, and the launch is massive but somewhat unwieldy.

Kou is lightning fast, at only four frames, meaning in certain situations it can be truly inescapable. However, Kou's grounded hitbox is rather small, just covering the area above Anji's shoulders, meaning many moves can low profile it without issue (or without even meaning to). Accordingly, Kou is generally preferred as an anti-air autoguard followup, where its vertical movement and speed shine, and its weakness to low profiles is mitigated. Notably, Kou builds a ludicrous amount of meter on hit, sometimes in excess of 50% if your tension pulse is good. This can work in your favor either way; savvy opponents may feel forced to burst to deny your meter gain, giving you a resource advantage, and eating the Kou will also give you a tremendous edge on resources. On hit, Kou will lead to a knockdown with a full connect, throwing the opponent fullscreen away. Partial connects are also possible, which will allow the opponent to tech in the air above Anji - this situation is safe, but not nearly as advantageous of course. In the corner, followups are possible, albeit difficult. On block, however, Kou is disastrous, at a whopping -41f and in counterhit state until it lands.

Boasting a generous amount of strike invulnerability and lots of forward movement, Sou is regarded as Anji's choice autoguard against grounded offense. Due to its 11 frames of strike invulnerability followed by loads of lower body invulnerability, Sou can even blow through projectile-based pressure resets, allowing Anji to fully steal turns from his opponents from the smallest of gaps. Due to its relatively low recovery and the high attack level of the last hit, it's possible to link off of the last hit to turn Sou hits into more substantial combos:  Standing characters: 5P is a 2f link, 2P and 5K are 1f links Crouching characters: 5P whiffs on most crouchers, 2P and 5K are 2f links Sou is best punished by trying to force a whiff, though be wary of its extremely active last hit, which can catch people off guard - and will wallsplat if it counterhits. Aside from using Dead Angles, Slashbacking Sou's last hit is generally the only recourse for dealing with it once it's blocked, since the last hit is still 0 on instant block. Sou also has an FRC during the first three active frames of the final hit, which allows for highly damaging extensions (dash 5S and 5H are both possible followups) and good corner carry. Should your opponent bait Sou, the FRC guarantees massive frame advantage on block, allows counterplay to the last hit Slashback (which is a counterhit punish otherwise), and lets you bail out of risky whiffs.

Anji leaps into the air before grabbing his opponent, switching sides, and throwing them to the floor. Depending on your combo routing, On's forced side switch can leave you facing midscreen from a corner combo, but Anji is still perfectly happy running okizeme facing into the midscreen as well. Furthermore, many of Anji's routes will deliberately side switch with the opponent before On, dropping them into the corner for a tight and well-spaced mixup. Notably, On throws the opponent to the ground at an ideal spacing for butterfly oki on virtually everyone, with only minor timing and spacing adjustments needed; using Shitsu as soon as you land will guarantee a properly meaty hit for establishing your pressure. On also does a surprising amount of damage, even fairly deep into combos, meaning efficient routes into On will effectively let you have your cake and eat it too; damage and okizeme. Though On is an air-unblockable hitgrab, meaning comparisons to Heat KnuckleGuard:Unblockable, FD×3Startup:14Recovery:22Advantage: are somewhat common, it should be understood that On is not a primary anti-air for Anji. On is wildly unsafe to whiff, and mis-using it can lead to forfeiting otherwise highly favorable situations - stick to Anji's other excellent anti-airs, such as 5P, 6P, or 5D's autoguard. Importantly, On has an FRC point from 11-13f, right as the grab would connect during its first three active frames. This gives Anji an incredibly strong OS against bursting his combo enders, since if the opponent doesn't burst, On will simply connect and grant you okizeme. If they do burst, however, you will FRC as On whiffs through their burst, able to block or throw their burst. Here's an example.

Both are slightly plus, and can be used as pressure resets or as mixup tools, though they are readily interruptible and will not guarantee Anji offense on block. P Kai is a short advancing hop that can cross up at close range. It hits as it lands, and will bounce opponents upwards with a small launch on hit. Due to its (relative to K Kai) speed and short trajectory, it can crush many attempts at abare, especially with crouching jabs and sweeps. K Kai is a massive leap with much more vertical and horizontal travel than P Kai, though it is also slower. It hits on the way down rather than upon landing, which makes it less safe on tall characters since it will hit relatively earlier. K Kai sees use as a pressure reset and crossup, much like P Kai, though it also works as niche tool for navigating around committal buttons with lots of horizontal reach, which Anji can normally struggle to deal with. K Kai also has an FRC right as Anji begins to descend. This FRC retains Anji's air actions, allowing him to airdash and jump, letting him leverage more complex overheads or empty lows from Kai. This FRC will also let Anji bail out of a Kai attempt if he thinks he's going to be intercepted, or wants to bait an autopiloted punish/interrupt.

For special projectiles like Justice's NukesGuard:AllStartup:7Recovery:Total 51Advantage:-13 or Venom's Dark AngelGuard:AllStartup:7+18Recovery:10Advantage:, FB Shitsu will simply not interact and pass through. This makes FB Shitsu a potent anti-zoning tool, where you can carve a line through another character's space control, or force them into the air to avoid it. The descending second and third hits of FB Shitsu are overheads rather than mids, allowing for high/low unblockables when paired with a low guard break like 2S, though you do need to hold your opponent in place between FB Shitsu's initial mid hit and later overhead hits. Some unblockable sequences include:  FB Shitsu (first hit) > 5S > delay 2S (guard break) > 5H > 236H - 'Standard' unblockable FB Shitsu (first hit) > 6S > 3K > 236S/H - 'Safe' unblockable It must be understood that FB Shitsu is not a flat upgrade over regular Shitsu, and it doesn't work in the same situations.

In practice, it is one of Anji's most powerful defensive tools. During FB Kou, Anji rapidly ascends before performing a special version of Shin, knocking the opponent down. FB Kou essentially merges the best features of Sou and Kou. It shares Sou's 11 frames of strike invulnerability and to-the-floor hitbox (even able to hit Grand ViperGuard:Low×7, MidStartup:17Recovery:37Advantage:-21), and pairs it with Kou's four-frame startup and rising trajectory. This combination of speed and invulnerability makes this move Anji's strongest tool for discouraging and punishing any sort of gap or read/guess on a meaty. On block, FB Kou is quite unsafe, but can be difficult to punish for unprepared players and some characters, since Anji recovers in the air well above superjump height for most characters, and retains his air actions. On hit, FB deals a substantial amount of damage (108 to Sol) and knocks down, giving you block pressure or slightly disadvantaged butterfly oki (Volcanic ViperGuard:MidStartup:7Recovery:21+10 after landingAdvantage:-28, for example, will punish an attempted butterfly).

Situationally useful when your opponent likes to stall on the top of the screen or as a callout against carless airdashing. Its start up makes it hard to combo into compared to normal On. Not a viable alternative to normal On as a combo ender. FRC works similar to normal On, but at 50 tension this can be difficult to justify.

Sai's damage ranges from decent to somewhat underwhelming, but with 12 hits, it is superb as a guts crush option, and completely workable as a damage dump from shorter confirms. From stray pokes, especially on normal hit and at range, Sai is actually Anji's best option in some situations - and capitalizing on Anji's ability to late cancel his normals makes confirming much easier. Sai does have some upper body and strike invulnerability, but not enough to allow it to be used as a reversal of any sort. The projectile will stay out even if Anji is hit, meaning it is possible force some hugely favorable trades, especially against projectile-based pressure resets, where you can simply recover and pick up the opponent with On to guarantee strong okizeme. On block, Sai is wildly unsafe, allowing for fairly reliable counterhit punishes by the entire cast. Sai also has an FRC at the end of the attack portion of the move, right as Anji stands up, which is surprisingly useful for a super FRC. On block, Sai FRC will bail you out, and potentially even allow for a cheeky overhead attempt - especially rewarding since Sai will seriously crank the RISC gauge. On hit, Sai FRC will let you continue your combo, including giving you an unburstable On, which is great for taking burst off the table until your next round of okizeme.

Anji leaps midscreen and performs a fast, multi-hit stomp on his way down. This super is somewhat mediocre, as Anji has better uses for meter and better ways to move about the screen. It can at least be an unconventional way to get out of the corner. It's 0 frames after the super flash, meaning the opponent would already have to be blocking or invincible before it starts, but it takes a while for the flash to start. Can do some ambiguous cross ups but the steep meter cost makes it not worthwhile. Has some invincibility, but other moves are more useful for that.

Kachou is generally considered underwhelming, given it is slower than FB Kou and only deals slightly more damage for twice the cost. However, it still does have a few distinct advantages - it is completely unburstable, zero frames post-flash (meaning it locks out inputs until the first hit has a chance to connect), and has some truly ludicrous horizontal and vertical range. Kachou also has an FRC immediately before its last hit, which elevates Kachou's damage from decent to astonishing, though it does require the investment of 75 meter total, or 100 if you want to use FB Rin, which is generally inadvisable unless it will end a round outright or assist with a massive comeback. The price associated with elevating Kachou's damage past that of Anji's B&B combos has basically singlehandedly rendered it obsolete when Anji has faster, scarier, and cheaper options available. Kachou has a unique quirk where, despite being 'autoguard-only,' it can be canceled into after an autoguard normal hits, provided the autoguard itself did catch something.
