He performs best at midrange with a variety of useful pokes, but Ky has tools at every range thanks to his Stun EdgeGuard:AllStartup:10Recovery:Total 41Advantage:-5 projectiles. He uses his fast, long f.S to harass his foes, and rounds out his neutral game with 2S, 5H, 2K, and 2D. Experienced Ky players can cancel into Stun DipperGuard:Low, MidStartup:8Recovery:26Advantage:-15 to secure knockdowns from afar. Frustrated opponents that jump at Ky will find themselves dealing with his above-the-knees invulnerable 6P and very tall 2H. When Ky is farther from the opponent he can use Stun Edges to harass, either covering his approach or playing keep away. After getting a knockdown, Ky safely sets up OkizemeFrom Japanese "起き攻め". Attacking an opponent about to wake up after they were knocked down, usually with meaty attacks or mix-ups. using Charged Stun EdgeGuard:AllStartup:43Recovery:Total 68Advantage:+18, 3H or j.D, then applies strong blockstring pressure, lacing together low attacks, frame traps, throws, and pressure resets with 6H, 6K, and powerful Force Breaks (FBs) to wear the enemy down. To turn the tide, Ky can use Stun Dipper to slide under attacks and score knockdowns, utilize his overhead Greed SeverGuard:High/AirStartup:18Recovery:5+11 after landingAdvantage:-14, or gamble with his reversal, Vapor ThrustGuard:MidStartup:11Recovery:30+13 after landingAdvantage:-33. Ky can rapidly switch between keeping the opponent away and applying pressure. Ky's balanced moveset has a tool for every situation, although he lacks specialization in any one role and can be locked out by specialist characters. While some are quick to assume Ky is a painfully basic character, he has many tricks in his arsenal that round out his game plan.

Pros Cons   Well Rounded and Well Ranged: Ky has plenty of normals with range, speed, and good frame data + versatile projectiles and traps make Ky effective up close, far away, and everywhere in between. Ky is also consistent in his ability to score knockdowns and establish advantage after winning neutral. Strong Pressure: Ky has a large list of pretty solid mixup tools—including 5K, j.S, j.D, j.214D, and Greed Sever, as well several tools to enforce frame advantage—such as 3H, Charged Stun Edge, and Lightning SphereGuard:MidStartup:6Recovery:4Advantage:+8. Paired with his open gatling table he can keep the opponent guessing and crank their Guard Gauge. Space Control: Ky has a suite of excellent pokes to help him control space, such as f.S, 2D, and 5H. He can reactively punish jumpins with 6P or control the sky with the disjointed j.S and j.HS. Tricky With Meter: Ky's FRCs and FBs are versatile, with them he can establish pressure, create combos, enhance mix ups, make himself safe, and more. Linear At Range: Ky's versatility is outclassed by most other projectile characters and characters with long range pokes. Trouble Keeping Pressure On: Ky's pressure is not flawed in and of itself, but keeping on the opponent requires resets, usually some meter, and usually leaves points for certain characters to confidently steal a turn. Low Average Damage: Ky's typical combo starters prorate heavily and converting into his high damage routes often requires several conditions such as meter and corner positioning. Meter Dependent: much of Ky's gameplan is locked behind having at least 25% meter for FRC or Force Break. Ky is forced to use meter to play neutral, keep pressure, or deal significant damage against opponents who outclass him in any particular area in order to keep pace with the rest of the cast.

Typically used to end blockstrings at frame advantage, or delay cancelled into Stun Dipper to end a combo. Sometimes cancelled into 6K to reset pressure, but this can be risky on whiff. Being a level 5 attack, it's also a good normal to cancel into Greed Sever with a minimal gap. Slightly shorter range than f.S but hits higher up and doesn't extend Ky's hurtbox as far. Heavily increases Guard Gauge. Ky's best raw starter. Preferred normal to loop airborne CH's when comboing with a flashing Guard Gauge.

Often cancelled into c.S for safety in the event of a clash or to hit confirm. Its invul can be used to beat some defensive options, such as  DAA, or Vapor Thrust.

Ky's slowest grounded normal other than 5D, in exchange for being ultra plus on block and option selecting most reversals when timed correctly. The Option Select works because 3H's recovery is extremely fast (only 3 frames). If you use it at the correct okizeme timing, you can hit the opponent with the last couple of active frames if they blocked, and recover in time to block if they did an invulnerable attack. This technique becomes more difficult the faster the opponent's reversal is, since the safe window shrinks. For example, against Sol it's a 1F window to correctly bait his H DP and have the second hit of 3H connect, because it has only 5F of startup. Against Ky you have a much larger window due to his Vapor Thrust having 11F of startup. Will not OS reversals that are 4F or faster. Forces opponent into crouching state on hit. Heavily increases Guard Gauge. The 2nd hit is a common target for  SB. Though this will negate Ky's absurd frame advantage, he is still safe.

Though this is his fastest normal, 2K may be the preferred link in certain situations where its superior range is necessary.

Covers a lot of options that Ky's standing pokes lose to, including very low-profile moves such as Sol's Grand Viper and 2D. Often cancelled into Stun Edge on hit or block, or layered with a 2D input to combo into a knockdown at closer ranges. Quite a disjointed hitbox. Being low to the ground avoids airdash attacks.

Because it's a bit slow and has no upper body invulnerability, it's usually used as a preemptive anti-air to beat airdashes and stop the opponent from jumping out of pressure. On block it's very safe since it can be jump canceled. The recovery on this move isn't insignificant, but it's quick for what it is. Pulls in on air hit. Launches on Counter Hit.

Changes every 2 frames       Damage Guard Startup Active Recovery On-Block Invuln   40 All 38 13 Total 20+11 after landing      j.D is a unique move. Ky creates an electric cross in the air that hangs in place a moment before exploding, launching on hit and even higher on counterhit. It's often used for okizeme to encourage the opponent to block, and in tricky crossup mixups after a solid knockdown. It can also be used in neutral to cover yourself from both air and grounded approaches, or be chained into from j.P and j.K to set up mixups, but it can be risky to use in these ways due to its long startup and high amount of landing recovery. The landing recovery for j.D will be applied even if Ky airdashes or does another attack in the air afterwards - unless Ky does a double jump, in which case he can land normally.

Poor when used on wakeup, since it's somewhat slow and easily whiffs on opponents doing low attacks, but useful as an an anti-air and in pressure. S version isn't invulnerable to the first active frame, so it may trade with the opponent's attacks. Launches the opponent higher than H version for better reward, making it an ideal anti-air. H version's invul extends into active frames, which means it's Ky's actual reversal. Air version mostly sees use as a combo filler.

Can also be used as a last ditch attempt to avoid being DP punished, but leaves Ky in CH state. S version blows the opponent away and downwards. Causes wallstick and can be used for combos near the corner or to push the opponent towards the corner from midscreen. Recovers faster than H version, doesn't bounce Ky as high up. Since Lightning Javelin can be performed even on whiff FRC point can make Vapor Thrust safe. H version blows the opponent away directly to the corner and wallbounces. Used to either combo the opponent midscreen or to knock down. The wallbounce leaves the opponent right next to Ky, allowing for a setup. Recovers slower than S version, bounces Ky higher up. Since Lightning Javelin can be performed even on whiff FRC point can make Vapor Thrust safe.

This can be caused by crouching, certain moves, and being short. Total: 57 A fast sliding low that can go underneath many attacks. Often used to end combos and as a risky last chance jump catch. Commonly RC'd to make it safe or to continue a combo. Be wary that the 2nd hit does not always combo from the 1st hit. This is distance dependent, because Ky slides a fixed distance before the slash. However, if the 1st hit is a counter hit, the 2nd hit is guaranteed to hit them. FRC point at the end of the slide. This is a great way to force opponents to deal with a mixup since afterwards, you can run up throw, run up continue pressure, run up overhead, etc. A lot of opponents like to burst on this move, using FRC will recover in time to bait and punish. Another gimmicky use is to do Stun Dipper FRC into Greed Sever for an overhead which which can surprise first time victims, but they'll catch on pretty quickly.

Though it's an okay mixup tool, it really shines when you use it early at a safe spacing to catch jumps, lows, air dashes and other neutral options. It's also good for beating answers to Ky's pressure that aren't fuzzy block or simply blocking, especially if they're trying to poke out of your pressure. Though it starts up fast (18F), it doesn't hit crouching opponents until later (roughly frame 24, earlier on larger characters). Loud and obvious visual/audio cue, so it's harder to hit than its startup implies. Can hop over low hitting moves and even low projectiles like Sol's GunflameGuard:AllStartup:21Recovery:Total 50Advantage:-3. Crosses up if done at point-blank range. On CH, it floats opponents higher and is completely untechable, opening up more combo routes.

Normally the damage dealt is minimal due to damage scaling, but it can be used after short combos that end in knockdown to make it worth the sacrifice in oki. Can whiff if input too late, in which case you are stuck in recovery for a quite a while. FRC point to continue a combo after knockdown.

Great in neutral for suddenly filling the space in front of you, in blockstrings for resetting pressure, and in high damage combos. Commonly used after 6K to confirm into a combo or reset pressure. Often you can catch an opponent reacting to the startup of 236D and attempting to jump over it with this attack. Vacuums opponent. Must be blocked with FD in the air.

Useful for punishing lows, discouraging movement, or as a gimmicky reversal option. On hit, combo into 222H, and optionally FRC to squeeze more damage out of the combo. Launches on Counter Hit for a combo, but it can be hit-or-miss which attacks it will counter hit. As a reversal option, it's great for beating moves that option select 623H, since these are typically lows.

It starts up exactly as fast as 623H, so it's a bit slow, but it moves horizontally rather than vertically so it will beat many options that are used to beat 623H. If TK'd, this move can be used in combos against airborne opponents. Invulnerable only through the startup and bit into the actual attack, will not move through projectiles. The aerial version can be used in combos if done as a low air juggle. FRC is good for staying safe on block or starting combos, but this is an expensive tactic at 75 meter + tension cooldown.

Damage Guard Startup Active Recovery On-Block Invuln   27×5 All 5+3  Total 36 +13      Total: 36 Usually used to add damage to combos. A common route is to use it after 2D. It's very plus on block which can allow you to reset pressure, but the meter cost is significant. While it is +13 on block, it's more meter efficient to use Lightning Sphere or Stun Edge FRC to reset pressure. 2D > 236236P is a bit character and distance specific, it isn't a totally stable combo. On some characters and distances, you can link 6H after. Semi-Unblockable Glitch: Perform a Charged Stun Edge > FRC > Sacred Edge. The CSE will continue to go forward during SE's super flash. If the opponent is not blocking pre-superflash, the CSE will hit them (assuming they are within range). This trick is rarely used.
