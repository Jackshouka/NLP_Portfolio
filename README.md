# NLP_Portfolio

## Overview
This is a portfolio for my Natural Language Processing class at The University of Texas at Dallas. My projects will be posted here throughout the semester. For now however, all I have here is an overview document that describes a few core ideas of NLP and some personal information on the subject, which can be found below.
