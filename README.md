# NLP_Portfolio

## Overview
This is a portfolio for my Natural Language Processing class at The University of Texas at Dallas. My projects will be posted here throughout the semester. For now however, all I have here is an overview document that describes a few core ideas of NLP and some personal information on the subject, which can be found below.

## Text Processing
This introductory python program reads in a csv file and processes the text in that file. We parse the information out and realize that it's a stand-in file for employee information. We create a simple class that displays that information after we process the text. To run in the command line, you'll need to specify a sysarg ('data/data.csv') like so: 'python3 person.py data/data.csv'.

What this assignment taught me about text processing in python was that it's pretty easy to do. Python feels almost over-engineered, so I found it to be really convienent at times. However, python doesn't really have any real memory management, so I feel a bit uncomfortable with how many lists I had to copy in order to edit and iterate over those lists to process them. There's a lot of dead space here, I feel.

Additionally, I learned a lot more about regex and class construction in python. Coming into this course, I had a pretty surface level exposure to python. I really was only capable of making more functional programs, but I know the basics of Class construction and have a better understanding on how to add parameters and methods to a class. I also was not too familiar with regex, and figured out that it was much easier than I had really feared.

You can access the folder and its files here.

## Word Guessing Game
This project was a simple word guessing game where we took a passage from an anatomy textbook, tokenized and lemmatized the raw text, tagged it and took the 50 most common nouns from that. From there, we implemented a simple command line game where users try to guess a random noun from that list of the 50 most common nouns we found in that textbook. The biggest challenge here was getting over my depression and getting this done. I was in a funk and not really up to doing much of anything, so being able to power through so I can learn something new was supremely difficult. However, it made completing it feel great. If you want to check it out, it'll be linked below.

## WordNet
This was a Jupyter notebook that took a look at WordNet, and its hierarchy of words using synsets and evaluating those words, how they fit on the hierarchy, synonyms, antonyms, hyper/hypo-nyms and so on. We also took a breif look at sentiWordNet, a sentiment anaylsis addon to WordNet that is relatively limited in what it can do, and Wu-Palmer/Lesk algorithms to evaluate word similarity. You can find it below.
